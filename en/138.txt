@Z: Vaccinating for Corona in San Francisco

<em>Angelika</em> For the whole last year we felt like we were in a perpetual
lockdown, and the whole world pitied the USA. It seemed like this great country
couldn't get a handle on the pandemic. Now it seems like everything has turned
around, because after some initial stumbling blocks, the vaccination campaign
has gotten off to a good start. In San Francisco, 60% have now received their
first vaccination and almost 40% are fully vaccinated. There is no longer any
prioritization, but anyone over 16 can make an appointment for a vaccination.

Across the US, there are now almost
<LINK>https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations|30 percent of all Americans are vaccinated.</LINK>
The same applies to California. In the
US, people receive either Moderna, Pfizer/Biontech
or Johnson and Johnson. The latter was temporarily suspended by the health
authorities due to some serious cases of thrombosis, but is now available
again. Other vaccines such as Astra Zeneca are not yet approved in the US.
Except for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, everyone needs two doses, which are
given here at intervals of 3-6 weeks. I received the Pfizer vaccine at
intervals of four weeks and am now fully vaccinated. Michael received his first
dose of Moderna on Easter and the second will be given on May 1st.
Interestingly, no one here says Pfizer/Biontech, but usually just Pfizer, while
we notice that it is always called Biontech/Pfizer in the German press.

How does the vaccination process work here? In the US, it was up to each
individual state to organize and determine who gets the vaccine first. The CDC
(Centers for Disease Control) released guidelines for this. In California, it
initially ran somewhat chaotically. They quickly agreed that medical and
nursing staff caring for coronavirus patients, as well as those over 80, would
be first in line, but then the tug-of-war and bargaining began. Who belonged in
the second priority group? The cashier at the supermarket, the teacher at
school, the homeless person, the field worker harvesting the vegetables? Or
should the younger ones with serious pre-existing conditions be first? Or
should they just go by age, as in some other states, such as Connecticut and
Maine?

Our Governor Gavin Newsom was a bit stressed because he was dealing with a
recall process and he didn't want to put his foot in it. In San Francisco,
everyone loves to discuss. We often have the impression that it is more about
who is right than about getting something done, but in the end they got
together and set the following order: In Phase 1A, people were eligible who
work with patients or in nursing homes, as well as residents of nursing homes
and seniors of advanced age. In Phase 1B, citizens over 65 followed, and people
working in schools or in the food industry and agriculture, as well as police
officers and firefighters. In mid-March, people of any age with chronic
illnesses, as well as prison inmates, homeless people and people in the
transport sector were next. From April 1st, citizens over 50 became eligible.
Since April 15th, everyone over 16 can register for a vaccination.

Since I work in a school, I was pretty quickly in line. However, things were
not running smoothly at the time either, and I had to navigate through the
chaos of decentralized regulations. Here too, one hand often does not know what
the other is doing. First of all, I had to inform myself about the
relevant regulations in the city of San Francisco and register on the
<LINK>https://sf.gov|city website</LINK>.
I answered a few questions online: age, occupation, any
pre-existing conditions, and if I live in cramped conditions (e.g. homeless
shelter). Then I gave my email, so the city could notify me when it was my turn.
Promptly I received confirmation that I was part of the Phase 1B group.

There were also a series of events in parallel.<LINK>myturn.ca.gov|California
State Registration Page</LINK>So I signed up too, following the motto that two
is better than one. Then it was a waiting game. In California, the authorities
decided to work with large health organizations such as Kaiser Permanente,
Sutter Health, Stanford Health, and in San Francisco, UCSF (University
Hospital). My primary care doctor is affiliated with UCSF, and since the
hospital has a good reputation in research, I regularly checked their Covid
information. And suddenly I saw that there were already vaccination offers for
school staff in a specially set up vaccination clinic, even though San
Francisco was not yet in Phase 1B.

So I quickly made an appointment through the patient portal "Mychart". I could
hardly believe my luck and thought at first that it might be a mistake. But on
Sunday, February 14th, we drove to the UCSF complex on Parnassus Avenue (UCSF
has buildings and hospitals spread throughout the city), and I received the
injection with the Pfizer vaccine. In the vaccination clinic, I had to quickly
answer the usual Covid questionnaire, show my California driver's license, and
say what time my appointment was. Then employees took me to a room that looked
like a classroom without desks. There were at least nine such vaccination
rooms. In mine, there were three chairs generously distributed in the room, on
which two already vaccinated people were sitting for observation. Then there
was one more chair on which the vaccination was to be done and I sat down
on it.

The vaccinator asked me for my name and birthdate again. Then he informed me
that I would be getting the Pfizer vaccine, which I hadn't known before. He
asked if I was okay with that and if I had ever had an allergic reaction to a
vaccine before. I didn't have to prove that I worked at a school, even though
the appointment listed what to bring as proof (pay stub or ID). Then I got the
shot. At the end, my vaccinator gave me an immunization card, which he had
written by hand what first dose I had just received and when. The document is
officially issued by the CDC, but looks like a white index card, which of
course is not tamper-proof, because there is not even an official stamp on it.

I had even brought my German vaccination passport, but nobody here could do
anything with it. After that, I joined the other vaccinated people and waited
the prescribed 15 minutes obediently on the chair, while I had a nice
conversation with my companions and Michael was already impatiently waiting for
me in the car outside. All the vaccinated people were euphoric. We naturally
exchanged our experiences of how we had managed to get the much sought-after
appointment. After the first vaccination, I felt nothing at all, except that my
arm with the injection site hurt a bit for a few days, which was not worth
mentioning. After four weeks, I made my way to the vaccination clinic again.
That was also a nerve-wracking experience, because the vaccine was still scarce
and there were always reports of shortages leading to the cancellation of
second vaccinations. But I was lucky. I got the second shot as
scheduled on March 14th. At first I felt great, almost a bit hyper, but the
next day I had slight body aches and a leaden fatigue. But all this only lasted
24 hours and then it was gone.

Michael is always happy to let me take the lead on things that involve a lot of
bureaucracy. However, it would be very impractical if one person in the family
was vaccinated and the other wasn't, so I insisted that he get vaccinated as
soon as he was eligible. Meanwhile, two large mass vaccination centers in San
Francisco had popped up, one at the Moscone Center downtown, and one at City
College near Balboa Park. The latter is a "drive thru", meaning you get
vaccinated while sitting in your car. That works for Michael.

Although the vaccination center at City College was also managed by the UCSF
healthcare center, this time you could not register through their own patient
portal, but only through the California site "myturn.ca.gov", which then
forwarded you to a third party, which of course did not please our data fox
Michael. As I said, they don't make it easy for those who want to be
vaccinated. However, there were actually appointments, and we drove to the
place at the agreed time at the beginning of April. Everything was highly
professionally organized. First we drove through a labyrinth of traffic cones.
Then Michael had to show his driver's license and the barcode he had received
online. A friendly man then stuck a red Post-it note on our windshield to
indicate that one person in the car had an appointment for vaccination; for
two, there would have been two Post-it notes accordingly. Then we drove to
another large parking lot. A dozen lanes each led to tent-like structures for
entry by car.

After driving under the tent, a few things were asked that Michael had already
answered online, but that's always the case here, as everyone prefers to
double-check.  The questions included possible allergies. It was also checked
whether Michael had already had Covid or had received certain treatments for
it. Then came the injection, and Michael didn't even have to get out of the
car, he just had to open the car door. Then he also received his vaccination
card and drove to a parking lot to wait 15 minutes as instructed. A nurse who
was patrolling between the parked cars told him to just press the horn if he felt
strange in any way.  After the 15 minutes had passed, we simply drove back home.

In addition to the large vaccination centers, drugstore chains "Walgreens",
"CVS" and "Rite-Aid" also offer vaccination appointments. The megamarket
"Costco" also vaccinates in its own pharmacy. However, family doctors are not
currently vaccinating here in California. But there are also smaller
vaccination sites where no appointment is needed. They are often found in
densely populated areas, or where mainly people who are not proficient in
English or overwhelmed by navigating the various providers live.

<pic images/vax-drive.ps After getting vaccinated, you must drive to a parking lot and wait for 15 minutes.>

Interestingly, we are now in the phase where there are more appointments available
than people willing to get vaccinated. People who were very eager to get the vaccine
and went to great lengths to get an appointment are now done with their second
dose. We now get almost daily emails or phone calls to notify us that there are
open appointments. As I said, communication is a bit lacking. This does not
necessarily mean that there is an army of anti-vaxxers, but many were just
waiting or not actively trying to get an appointment. I also read in the New
York Times that 8% do not show up for their second appointment because they are
either afraid of the side effects or think one dose is enough. For some, their
second appointment was cancelled due to lack of vaccine and they just gave up,
which is not a problem with Johnson and Johnson since only one dose is needed.
So let's hope people don't lose faith. I can't wait for the coronavirus to be
over.

@Z: Fry's Electronics has gone bankrupt.

<em>Michael</em> I remember my first visit to the electronics discount store
"Fry's Electronics" 24 years ago. We had just moved to California, the gold
rush in Silicon Valley was in full swing, and anyone looking to buy computer
components regularly hung around one of the many scattered Fry's branches to
marvel at the incredible prices and even more incredible discounts. At Fry's I
saw for the first time that a product was offered in a store at a negative
price, a package of disks for $0.99, with a $1.99 mail-in rebate.

Each Fry's branch was decorated according to a certain theme; the store on
Brokaw Road in San Jose was like a pyramid in the land of the Pharaohs, a
monstrous UFO burst through the wall of the Burbank strip mall, and in the Palo
Alto branch, cowboys and Indians of the Wild West showed what it was like in
the 19th century in the area. Full-size concert grand pianos were scattered
around the stores, automatically playing classical pieces. And not to forget
the giant magazine stand, which carried the current "Linux Magazine", the
vehicle of your humble writer's programming column. But most importantly, the
chain was a huge success; shoppers crowded into the stores late into the night,
loaded their newly purchased, state-of-the-art PC hardware into their cars, and
a real geek scene flourished there.

These times are obviously long gone, the online giants have completely drained
the presence of department stores in the last ten years. Strangely, Fry's
stores still held on, even though there were hardly any customers and hardly
any products in the shelves. Since Fry's was not listed on the stock exchange
being a privately owned company, no one could look into the books and estimate
how long the empire would last.

However, the store had always operated on the edge of legality, it was widely
known that they would simply re-seal exchanged products in plastic wrap and
sell them as new, which is illegal in California. I also saw increasingly
disgruntled and desperate employees on my dwindling visits, so I would have bet
good money for the past five years that the store would eventually close.
Recently, some YouTubers even went out to visit scattered branches and pointed
to the empty shelves making long faces.

Now it's official: Fry's has officially filed for bankruptcy in February 2021
and closed all of its stores. The battle is lost, but "It was good while it
lasted", as we say here in America.
