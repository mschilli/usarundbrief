@Z: Vaccinating for Corona in San Francisco

<em>Angelika</em> For the whole last year we felt like we were in a perpetual
lockdown, and the whole world pitied the USA. It seemed like this great country
couldn't get a handle on the pandemic. Now it seems like everything has turned
around, because after some initial stumbling blocks, the vaccination campaign
has gotten off to a good start. In San Francisco, 60% have now received their
first vaccination and almost 40% are fully vaccinated. There is no longer any
prioritization, but anyone over 16 can make an appointment for a vaccination.

Across the US, there are now almost

The same applies to California. In the
US, people receive either Moderna, Pfizer/Biontech
or Johnson and Johnson. The latter was temporarily suspended by the health
authorities due to some serious cases of thrombosis, but is now available
again. Other vaccines such as Astra Zeneca are not yet approved in the US.
Except for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, everyone needs two doses, which are
given here at intervals of 3-6 weeks. I received the Pfizer vaccine at
intervals of four weeks and am now fully vaccinated. Michael received his first
dose of Moderna on Easter and the second will be given on May 1st.
Interestingly, no one here says Pfizer/Biontech, but usually just Pfizer, while
we notice that it is always called Biontech/Pfizer in the German press.

How does the vaccination process work here? In the US, it was up to each
individual state to organize and determine who gets the vaccine first. The CDC
(Centers for Disease Control) released guidelines for this. In California, it
initially ran somewhat chaotically. They quickly agreed that medical and
nursing staff caring for coronavirus patients, as well as those over 80, would
be first in line, but then the tug-of-war and bargaining began. Who belonged in
the second priority group? The cashier at the supermarket, the teacher at
school, the homeless person, the field worker harvesting the vegetables? Or
should the younger ones with serious pre-existing conditions be first? Or
should they just go by age, as in some other states, such as Connecticut and
Maine?

Our Governor Gavin Newsom was a bit stressed because he was dealing with a
recall process and he didn't want to put his foot in it. In San Francisco,
everyone loves to discuss. We often have the impression that it is more about
who is right than about getting something done, but in the end they got
together and set the following order: In Phase 1A, people were eligible who
work with patients or in nursing homes, as well as residents of nursing homes
and seniors of advanced age. In Phase 1B, citizens over 65 followed, and people
working in schools or in the food industry and agriculture, as well as police
officers and firefighters. In mid-March, people of any age with chronic
illnesses, as well as prison inmates, homeless people and people in the
transport sector were next. From April 1st, citizens over 50 became eligible.
Since April 15th, everyone over 16 can register for a vaccination.

Since I work in a school, I was pretty quickly in line. However, things were
not running smoothly at the time either, and I had to navigate through the
chaos of decentralized regulations. Here too, one hand often does not know what
the other is doing. First of all, I had to inform myself about the
relevant regulations in the city of San Francisco and register on the
<LINK>https://sf.gov|city website</LINK>.
I answered a few questions online: age, occupation, any
pre-existing conditions, and if I live in cramped conditions (e.g. homeless
shelter). Then I gave my email, so the city could notify me when it was my turn.
Promptly I received confirmation that I was part of the Phase 1B group.

There were also a series of events in parallel.<LINK>myturn.ca.gov|California
State Registration Page</LINK>So I signed up too, following the motto that two
is better than one. Then it was a waiting game. In California, the authorities
decided to work with large health organizations such as Kaiser Permanente,
Sutter Health, Stanford Health, and in San Francisco, UCSF (University
Hospital). My primary care doctor is affiliated with UCSF, and since the
hospital has a good reputation in research, I regularly checked their Covid
information. And suddenly I saw that there were already vaccination offers for
school staff in a specially set up vaccination clinic, even though San
Francisco was not yet in Phase 1B.

So I quickly made an appointment through the patient portal "Mychart". I could
hardly believe my luck and thought at first that it might be a mistake. But on
Sunday, February 14th, we drove to the UCSF complex on Parnassus Avenue (UCSF
has buildings and hospitals spread throughout the city), and I received the
injection with the Pfizer vaccine. In the vaccination clinic, I had to quickly
answer the usual Covid questionnaire, show my California driver's license, and
say what time my appointment was. Then employees took me to a room that looked
like a classroom without desks. There were at least nine such vaccination
rooms. In mine, there were three chairs generously distributed in the room, on
which two already vaccinated people were sitting for observation. Then there
was one more chair on which the vaccination was to be done and I sat down
on it.

The vaccinator asked me for my name and birthdate again. Then he informed me
that I would be getting the Pfizer vaccine, which I hadn't known before. He
asked if I was okay with that and if I had ever had an allergic reaction to a
vaccine before. I didn't have to prove that I worked at a school, even though
the appointment listed what to bring as proof (pay stub or ID). Then I got the
shot. At the end, my vaccinator gave me an immunization card, which he had
written by hand what first dose I had just received and when. The document is
officially issued by the CDC, but looks like a white index card, which of
course is not tamper-proof, because there is not even an official stamp on it.

I had even brought my German vaccination passport, but nobody here could do
anything with it. After that, I joined the other vaccinated people and waited
the prescribed 15 minutes obediently on the chair, while I had a nice
conversation with my companions and Michael was already impatiently waiting for
me in the car outside. All the vaccinated people were euphoric. We naturally
exchanged our experiences of how we had managed to get the much sought-after
appointment. After the first vaccination, I felt nothing at all, except that my
arm with the injection site hurt a bit for a few days, which was not worth
mentioning. After four weeks, I made my way to the vaccination clinic again.
That was also a nerve-wracking experience, because the vaccine was still scarce
and there were always reports of shortages leading to the cancellation of
second vaccinations. But I was lucky. I got the second shot as
scheduled on March 14th. At first I felt great, almost a bit hyper, but the
next day I had slight body aches and a leaden fatigue. But all this only lasted
24 hours and then it was gone.
