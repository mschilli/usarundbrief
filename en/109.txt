@Z: Bike theft and miraculous return

<pic images/bike-thief-yt.ps (#2) A thief is carrying a stolen bike up the stairs from a parking garage, taped by a surveillance camera.>

<em>Michael</em>
Lately, there's an upswing on burglaries in our neighborhood, as we 
know first-hand from Nextdoor (<RBLINK>20140914#5</RBLINK>). 
About six months ago, we fell victim to a burglar too, who cracked open 
the lock to our parking garage and stole my bicycle. I had been aware
that dubious creatures keep wandering around there at night, and took
precautions by locking the bick with a thick solid metal lock and tied
the bike to a steel pipe by means of a metal cable. 

Alas, the thief apparently had brought along a bolt cutter, because when
Angelika set out to drive off in the morning, she noticed that the cable
was cut and the bike was gone. Thinking back, I had purchased the bicycle
exactly 16 years ago at the price of $400, and although the loss hurt because I
had put countless hours into replacing worn out or stolen parts over the years,
it wasn't the end of the world. I filed a police report by calling the
non-emergency number 553-0123 in San Francisco, and was pleasantly surprised to
see that later that same day, two police officers showed up at my doorstep to
investigate.  I showed them around in the garage and answered questions about
the bike while they were scribbling notes into their notebooks. 
Well, to be honest, I didn't get my hopes up and soon forgot about the 
whole thing.  

<pic images/bike-theft-cable-cut.ps The burglar used a bolt cutter to sever the steel cable lock.>

Six months later, a downtown San Francisco police officer called us at home, 
leaving a message with Angelika that he had recovered my bicycle. The good
news came quite by surprise, and I was asked to stop by the police station
on 6th Street in San Francisco after work.

If you don't know your way around downtown San Francisco, let me assure you
that it's a lot cleaner now than 20 years ago, with less homeless people
crowding the streets. But if you're curious about taking in a lasting
impression of one of the most run-down city areas, I recommend you stroll down
6th Street at the brink of dusk. It's almost like being placed into the
ficticious world of the TV series "Walking Dead", where one needs to constantly
be on high alert, making sure to not get caught and eaten by individuals who
are romping around there and apparently drugged up to their eyeballs.  That
being said, I don't think the locals there are really a public threat, because
I'd be surprised if any of them could actually afford a gun, mainly because all
of their money is most likely spent on the next crack pipe. 
Which reminds me, there's been a
<LINK>http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/sfo/27499971.html|funny article on
Craigslist on crack pipes</LINK> lately, which you might enjoy.

<pic images/sf-6th-st-police.ps (#3) The 6th Street station of the San Francisco police looks somewhat dubious, but it is real.>

So I ended up waiting in the middle of this mess, like an idiot with my 
laptop-filled backpack, in front of a strangely shabby but apparently real
(Flying US flag, surveillance cameras) police station, which 
was closed shut! I got my phone out and texted the officer, who told me
he'd already gone home for the day but a fellow officer would stop by 
soon to get me my bike back. A while later, 
I saw a few cops patrolling down 6th street and asked them about their
colleague. They knew about the case, and one of them asked me to follow
him to a storage room nearby. On the way there, he stopped several
somewhat beligerent hoodlums hanging out on the sidewalk and even searched
one guy's bag! I was following at a distance feeling really uneasy, 
silently cursing about having agreed to this handover.

But, low and behold, after a few minutes we arrived at a storage room, the
officer unlocked the door and I spotted a seriously deteriorated version
of my bike. The frame was the same as on my original, but all other parts like
handlebar, saddle, and gears had been replaced by cheaper components.
Brakes were lacking entirely. The officer asked me if the bicycle was 
in rideable condition, which I was somewhat skeptic about and illustrated
my point by bringing attention to the missing brakes. But since they all
had been working hard to get my stolen property back, I decided to give 
them a break and took the bike with me. I called Angelika to pick me up 
by car downtown, we stuffed the bike into the trunk and drove
home. I placed the bike back into the garage, where it's been waiting since 
for the next burglar to appear.

<pic images/bait-bike-sticker.ps (#1) The "Bait Bike" sticker is supposed to deter thieves.>

The police officer asked me to apply a so-called "Bait Bike" sticker to my 
bike (Figure (#1)). This was news to me, and the officer explained that 
some bikes are allegedly left out there on purpose 
and equipped with GPS transmitters, so that if they're stolen, the
location of the thief can be pinpointed. Getting a transponder onto every
single bike would be prohibitively expensive, so all non-equipped bikes simply 
get a sticker, which will allegedly deter potential thieves. Personally,
I'm not too sure this approach will actually work, but at least it won't 
cost much to try.

Bicycle thieves in San Francisco have pretty much free reign, there's 
no real effort by the city to stop this kind of petty crime. 
<LINK>http://sfist.com/2014/06/06/mission_bike_thief_caught_in_the_ac.php|News repots|News reports on bicycle thieves</LINK> and even entire
<LINK>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D-JeFv-SjY|videos of bicycle thieves in action</LINK> (Figure (#2)) show that there really is a problem. What's funny
is that the thief caught on camera turns out differently than you might
expect at first: That white dude with his backpack 
looks like a hipster who just got off the Google bus!

<pic images/safe-bikes-org.ps Police recommends you register your bike with a photo on this website.>

It looks like hawking stolen bikes is a profitable business in the 
Bay Area. I've even seen <LINK>http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/30393216796/what-happens-to-stolen-bicycles|scientific publications</LINK>on the economics of
stolen bicycles. And one remarkable theft victim combed through Craigslist 
postings, searching for his stolen bike, and hit paydirt 600 miles north, in Portland, Oregon. He went there and <LINK>http://www.digitaltrends.com/apple/burner-iphone-app-bike-thief-video/#!bI4X4d|took the thief to task</LINK>. Well worth watching!

@Z: Petty Crime on the Rise

<pic images/sf-plant-thief.ps (#5) Homeless guy stealing succulent plants from someone's sidewalk flower bed.>

<em>Michael</em>
Reactions differ significantly. 
Some residents stoically ignore the rising crime rate, 
while others go ballistic even with petty crime, like when homeless people 
steal their potted plants in front of their houses, to sell them to nearby 
nurseries.
Recently, one of the culprits was caught red-handed on camera, by a 
so-called Spotcam surveillance cam mounted by the home owner to 
monitor their premises (Abbildung (#5)).
As you can imagine, this started a major dispute on Nextdoor between
relentless law and order men and droves of confrontation-averse hippie 
idiots populating San Francisco, who send their children to Montessori 
schools.

Or take the package thieves: Since postal delivery employees often
simply drop packages at people's doorsteps if no one is at home,
apparently there's now a number of individuals patrolling our
neighborhood to quickly steal those deliveries. But since many of
the wealthy home owners are running so-called Dropcams, which are
easy to set up even for the technically not inclined, a lot
of caught-in-the-act videos have made it to Youtube, like
this <LINK>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp7XsXYmQVo|footage of two package thieves in Noe Valley</LINK>. 
After several of her packages had gone missing, a Chinese lady in our
neighborhood had had enough, trapped the thief, hunted him down
armed with a traditional Chinese sword (a so-called "bokken"), and finally
<LINK>http://sfist.com/2012/11/29/noe_valley_woman_nabs_package_thief.php|knocked him out with a can of bear spray purchased at a local outdoor store</LINK>.
Alas, vigilantism is illegal in the United States, which prompted the
thief's attorney now to in turn file a law suit against the lady.

<pic images/porch-theft.ps The surveillance cam caught the package thief entering the premises.>

But it's getting worse. Lately, several citizens were robbed at gunpoint
in the late evening hours. According to the news this happened by 
"young african americans" who must have been traveling to our neighborhood 
solely for that purpose from other areas. Apparently, many techies 
are carrying backpacks holding $1,000 laptops even at night, and everyone
owns a $600 smartphone these days, 
making them a profitable target, especially since
SF police rarely patrols the rich neighborhoods and so far has not made
arrests. Not too long ago, 
a <LINK>http://sfist.com/2014/11/24/man_shot_and_killed_during_duboce_p.php|robbery victim was even shot by the mopes</LINK>! 

As a result, late night party goers now hesitate to go five blocks in our 
neighborhood, although it is considered to be rather
safe in comparison. Even supervisor Scott Wiener, the jack-of-all-trades
in San Francisco politics, has had a rude awakening and is now planning
on sending more cops to patrol the rich parts of town. As always in
San Francisco, this kind of measure has to be approved by the voters, 
the proposition is coming to the ballots soon.

@Z: Diluvian Rainfall

<pic images/sf-rain-flood.ps As soon as San Francisco gets a bit more rain than usual, some streets are flooded. Foto: flickr[Frédéric Poirot|fredarmitage/15377842444]>

<em>Angelika</em>
Last Thursday, the weather gods bestowed us with heavy rainfall, so much
in fact, that San Francisco and its surrounding areas reported 
flooding emergencies.
While California truly needs the rain because of the
ongoing drought, the extremely dry grounds can't absorb the water of 
prolonged rainfall, and water starts to dam up. And the hopelessly obsolete
infrastructure with poorly patched-up roads makes things worse, of course.

<pic images/shuttle-rain.ps The Yahoo morning shuttle on the freeway, stopped by heavy rainfall.>

I've got to admit that I found the brouhaha created by the press on Wednesday
about the upcoming rain storm rather annoying. As soon as there's rain, all
those sun-spoiled Californians go nuts and hopelessly exaggerate.  Because I
grew up in northern Germany, rain is very natural to me and just makes me
chuckle. You can imagine how I was rolling my eyes when the news announced that
several school district were closing their facilities on Thursday because of
the rain. Back in the Lower Saxony part of Germany were I grew up, the only
time I can think of that schools were closed were when we had black ice or wind
blowing with more than 60mph.

<pic images/sand-bags-2.ps This citizen expects flooding caused by prolonged rain and prepared by laying down sand bags.>

<pic images/sand-bags-1.ps This sand bag arrangement seems to require some more work to withstand significant rainfall.>

Even our Chrismas party at work was cancelled. And on Thursday morning, 
when I tried to drive to work I got stopped cold: An underpath on
Cezar Chavez Street I needed to pass through, 
about seven minutes from our house, was flooded and traffic came to 
a complete stop. Luckily, 3-wheel meter maid scooter had blocked off the area,
so no one got stuck in the water, but this meant I could neither proceed forward
into the water nor back out because of the stalled traffic behind me.

<pic images/beach-closed.ps A popular surf beach in Pacifica has been closed because of heavy rainfall.>

The meter maid advised me to make U-turn on the four-lane road. Alas, this
turned out to be quite difficult because the street had a center devider with a
curb, but somehow I managed finally to drive over it, turn around and drive
back home. On Friday, everything was back to normal. But Michael was really
bummed out after he saw that his favorite surf beach in Pacifica was closed due
to the heavy rainfall and the amount of sewage that had been swept into 
the ocean. A sign on the beach strongly advised surfers to stay out of the 
water that weekend. Oh my!

@Z: Never Ending Constructions

<pic images/construction.ps A newly rich paid 1 million Dollars for this run-down building.>

<em>Michael</em>
American construction sites all have one annoying thing in common. 
Regardless if it's a
big project like earth-quake proofing the Bay Bridge or renovating 
a run-down house around the corner: 
They keep dragging on for years and years. It appears that there's
no affordable way for the owner to draft a contract to ensure that a 
building is ready by a specified date. According to my personal research,
simple home renovations in our neighborhood take more than a year
on average. And remodeling the Bay Bridge, as you might have heard, took
more than 30 years.

<pic images/sf-1155.ps The collapsing dog house in the center sold for 1 Million Dollars, and I'm not kidding.>

To give you an example, recently, a nouveau-riche dimwit bought a fixer upper in our neighborhood for the astounding amount of <LINK>http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1155-1157-Church-St-San-Francisco-CA-94114/15147079_zpid/|1,000,000 (one Million Dollars)|Run-down fixer upper sold for 1 Million.</LINK>, evicted the
family who had been living there for decades, and has spent the last two
years employing Mexican day laborers to renovate it.
At the end of 2013, a few individuals appeared, starting to make a lot of
noise, but little progress, seemingly unmotivated, almost like hobbyists.
Every day at 7:30 in the morning, they started hammering and sawing like
crazy, only to suddenly cease work at 9:00, with no following activity for 
many hours.  Later in the day, 
occasionally, you could hear timid hammering noises here and there, 
but rather lackadasical, apparantly without accomplishing anything of value 
until the end of the day. The construction company "Rodriguez Builders"
has now been on the project for about a year and keeps throwing the 
construction waste into the front yard. Sometimes, there's one worker
dabbling here and there, sometimes there's three of them making infernal
noises on Saturday mornings with a table saw that they're switching on
once per hour to cut some wood, instead of cutting all the wood at once
and be done with it. 

<pic images/construction-saw.ps The day laborer eyes the table saw with suspicion: Should I saw today or postpone it till tomorrow?>

This raises the question: How can someone who poured 1 million Dollars into
a fixer upper be so stupid as to be taken for a ride by a construction
company who's apparently progressing at their own discretion, pushing out
the completion date time and time again? You would think that the owner be
interested in having the house ready as soon as possible, either to
move in himself or rent it out to the tune of 5,000 Dollars per month.

I'm not sure what's going on, maybe the owner ran out of money and he's
delaying the project to avoid paying property taxes (a whopping
<LINK>http://homeguides.sfgate.com/calculate-california-property-taxes-newly-purchased-home-2875.html|14,000 Dollars per year|Property Taxes in San Francisco</LINK>), because he'd fall off a financial cliff otherwise? We'll never know
for sure, but the fact he paid 1 million for a doghouse seems to substantiate
my suspicion that he might not be the brightest person around and probably 
blindly fell prey to the real estate parasites who are now sucking him
out for good. I can't say that I feel sorry.

<pic images/construction-phone.ps Construction worker on the phone.>

<pic images/construction-permit.ps Every construction site is required to display the permit issued by the city.>

The other day, our local news station reported that Facebook CEO Mark
Zuckerberg purchased a building in our neighborhood for an exorbitant
amount of money and <LINK>http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Neighbors-feeling-squeezed-by-work-on-Mark-5771069.php|the neighbors are complaining about the disturbance</LINK>, because the builder has been making noise 
every single day for an entire year now!
If you're intersted, "Fort Zuckerberg" went for 10 Million Dollars.
At night, there's a security guard watching over the premise. It seems
that money is no issue for Zuckerbertie.

@Z: Las Vegas, Baby!

<pic images/lv-main-street-casino.ps The "Main Street Casino", located in Old Town Las Vegas.>

<em>Angelika</em>
We keep going back to Las Vegas, and if it is just because this is where
we met for the first time, both travelling the U.S. independently during 
a long long summer break. Las Vegas keeps reinventing itself, and it's hard
to keep track on how fast things are changing. Both being college students  
back in the day, we were drawn there by the unbeatably low expenses in
gambler's paradise: There were all-you-can-eat buffets for only five Dollars
and rental cars were cheap, too, to explore the nearby world-renowned
national parks. It was not until a few years later that newly themed casinos
like the "New York New York", "Treasure Island", or the
pyramid-shaped "Luxor" were built on the strip.

Then came a time of economic slowdown, and hardly anyone could be convinced
to travel to Las Vegas, unless hotels offered killer deals. Savvy 
travelers set themselves apart from the masses and
splurged 150 Dollars per night for dream rooms with two 
separate levels or round 200 gallon jacuzzis.
Recently, ultra modern hotel towers are all the rage, like the
"Aria" or the "Cosmopolitan", featuring contemporate room decor 
and all kinds of technical gadgets for the iPhone and Youtube generation.

<pic images/lv-shoe.ps Time has been standing still on Fremont Street in Las Vegas Old Town.>

While this was happening, prices exploded in Las Vegas. It's not as easy
anymore to find reasonably priced rooms on the Las Vegas Strip and 
the cheap all-you-can-eat buffets have vanished like CD sales. 
Restaurants by internationally acclaimed chefs like Gordon Ramsey,
Wolfgang Puck, or Joel Robuchon are the new trend. But it's not an easy
task for any chef in Las Vegas to impress guests coming from culinary relevant 
metropolitan areas. We've come to realize that upscale food options in
Las Vegas don't quite match what you'd get in San Francisco, let alone that
most Las Vegas establishments nowadays 
are tourist traps that are about twice as 
expensive as top-notch places in, say, Los Angeles. 
It's evident that the restaurants on the
strip have found out that business people from rural America are happy
to overpay, because they're flush with money and don't know any better
than mistake mediocre food for high-end cuisine, because at home they're 
eating dinner at the local diner with their baseball cap on.

<pic images/lv-prime-rib.ps Many years ago, there were many restaurants like that on the Las Vegas Strip.>

I've got to say, though, that we were pretty impressed with the
"L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon" restaurant inside the MGM casino. It's
expensive, but you get excellent classic french food with a modern touch. 
There's a more formal and yet more expensive restaurant "Joel Robuchon" 
next door, but if you like it more casual and enjoy watching the cooks
preparing your food from the counter, I'd recommend L'Atelier with its
exquisite food and wine selection.

<pic images/lv-oscars.ps Hard to imagine what kind of slogans advertisers used for restaurants back in the 50ies.>

During our last stay in Las Vegas, we strayed from 
Las Vegas Boulevard ("The Strip") a couple of times and explored other
neighborhoods. We revisited Downtown Las Vegas again after a long hiatus,
birthplace of many famous casinos, and playground for the mob way back 
when. The Mob Museum there charges quite an exorbitant entrance fee, but
it's quite fascinating to study the criminal history of Las Vegas, going
back to the times of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly.

<pic images/lv-old-ladies.ps Mostly older folks swarm Downtown Las Vegas to play the slot machines.>

Downtown Las Vegas faded into insignificance in the 1960ies, when 
a construction frenzy started on the "strip" and the casinos opened their
doors there. The gambling parlors in Downtown lost their glamor and 
started to attract an audience known as "low rollers", who prefer to 
work the five cent slot machines. But recently, there's been a wave
of nostalgia, and many follow the trend to explore old Las Vegas again.
Looking at the interior of the "Main Street Station Casino" gives a taste
of a different long-lost era. Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos (a popular
online shop for shoes), is driving an initiative to turn Downtown 
Las Vegas around to lure a younger crowd to this long neglected part of 
town.

<pic images/lv-container-park.ps The newly opened "Container Park" in Old Town Las Vegas.>

Hsieh first transferred his firm's headquarters to downtown Las Vegas 
und then invested 350 million Dollars of his own money into the
so called Downtown Project. The goal is to get small independent stores,
companies, and restaurants into the downtown area. The
<LINK>http://downtowncontainerpark.com|Containerpark|Containerpark Las Vegas</LINK>
on Freemont Street is a good example. Surrounding a big playground, small
container-like buildings are hosting shops and restaurants. All over the
property, chairs and tables invite visitors to sit down and relax in the sun.

<pic images/lv-container-park-table.ps At the container park, tables and chairs are invite visitors to sit down and relax.>

Ein wirklich ansprechendes Konzept, denn in Las
Vegas findet man in der Regel nur noch Kettengeschäfte. In diesem Containerpark
entdeckte ich dann auch das nette Geschäft "Blu Marble" (siehe Toppprodukt weiter unten).
Die ersten berühmten Chefköche haben ebenfalls den Trend entdeckt und
eröffnen kleinere Restaurants in Downtown Las Vegas. Kerry Simon, ein bekannter
Chefkoch in Las Vegas, setzte mit dem neuen Restaurant 
<LINK>http://carsonkitchen.com|"Carson Kitchen"|Carson Kitchen Las Vegas</LINK> ein
Zeichen. Wir haben es natürlich gleich
ausprobiert. Das Essen war super lecker und wurde zu einem vernünftigen
Preis angeboten. Und wir fühlten uns, als würden wir in einem Restaurant in San
Francisco sitzen. Ja, es tut sich etwas in Downtown Las Vegas.

Las Vegas ist nicht gerade eine Stadt, in der Umweltschutz groß geschrieben
wird. Ich würde einmal behaupten, dass Las Vegas auf der Top-10-Liste der
Umweltsünder steht. Recycling befindet sich immer noch in den Kinderschuhen.
Man stößt zwar mittlerweile auf Mülleimer am Flughafen, in denen der
Reisende seinen Müll trennen kann, aber die Casinos sind leider noch nicht
Trendführer in Sachen Recycling. 

Deswegen war ich ganz aus dem Häuschen, als
ich im neuen Containerpark in Downtown Las Vegas das kleine Geschäft mit dem
schönen Namen <LINK>http://www.blumarble.com|"Blu Marble"</LINK> entdeckte. 
Dort gab es allerlei Sachen aus Glas, unter anderem auch schöne Ketten 
mit Glasanhängern.
Bei den Ketten musste ich natürlich gleich zuschlagen und als ich den großen
runden Glasanhänger genauer betrachtete, fielen mir die Gänse auf, die im
Glas eingearbeitet waren und mich sehr an die auf der bekannten Wodkaflasche
"Grey Goose" erinnerten. Die Verkäuferin im Laden klärte mich dann auf, dass
alle ihre Produkte aus Flaschen hergestellt werden, die sie von den Casinos in
Las Vegas erhalten und die sonst im Müll landen würden. Der Anhänger meiner
Kette war tatsächlich früher eine "Grey-Goose-Flasche" gewesen. 15.000
Flaschen sammelt Blu Marble im Monat vom Las Vegas Strip ein. Toppidee und
Toppprodukt.

@Z: Schnurrbartmonat November

<pic images/movember.ps Mein Schnurrbart Mitte November.>

<em>Michael</em>
Einer der etwas skurrileren Bräuche in unserer verrückten Gegend ist, dass
sich viele Männer im Monat November einen Schnurrbart wachsen lassen. Da
Schnurrbart auf Amerikanisch "Mustache" heißt, spricht man deshalb auch gern
vom Monat <LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movember|"Movember"</LINK>.

Das Ganze dient einem guten Zweck, denn die Schnurr\-bart\-träger
machen damit auf typisch männliche Krankheiten wie Prostatakrebs
aufmerksam, die sich durch rechtzeitig durchgeführte Vorsorge\-untersuchungen
schnell erkennen und oft gut behandeln lassen.

In der Firma hat zum Beispiel unser Abteilungsleiter für jeden Mitarbeiter,
der sich Anfang November glatt rasierte und dann 30 Tage lang einen Schnurrbart
wachsen ließ, $100 in die Kasse der Movember-Foundation gespendet, die
damit irgendwelche Gesundheitsprogramme finanziert. Ich war natürlich mit
dabei, ließ mir einen beachtlichen Schnurrbart wachsen und konnte mir oft
das Lachen nicht verkneifen, wenn ich mal wieder in einem Meeting mit zehn
Schnurrbartträgern saß.
Wegen Gleichberechtigung durfte natürlich auch die Damenwelt mitmachen,
wer auf der Abschlusskundgebung Ende November mit einem aufgeklebten
Schnurrbart erschien, wurde ebenfalls mitgezählt.

Grüße aus dem verrückten Land:
