@Z: APEC in San Francisco: Biden is visiting

<pic images/apec-fence-door-open.ps During the APEC conference, the streets of San Francisco were blocked off with barriers.>

<em>Angelika</em> Even German newspapers have written a lot about the decline
of San Francisco this year, and especially Downtown San Francisco was
characterized as an apocalyptic place where only homeless and drug addicts
wander through the streets. It's not quite that bad yet, although it is
true that San Francisco's downtown has been struggling with horrific
problems that have exacerbated during the pandemic, and then continued
into a downward spiral.

Since the pandemic, over 30% of office buildings in San Francisco's downtown
area have been vacant, coinciding with new trends like remote work on three
days of the week. Many companies have downsized their offices, leading to fewer
people frequenting the shops in downtown San Francisco or buying and eating
lunch there, which then leads to more shop closures due to a lack of customers.
A vicious cycle.

Even before the pandemic, cities worldwide have struggled with the concept of a
downtown shopping district, primarily due to the boom of e-commerce. San
Francisco compensated for this quite well pre-COVID and lockdown by attracting
tourists and conferences that filled up hotel rooms in downtown and kept nearby
stores afloat. And as long as the city's tax revenues was stable, city
politicians blissfully ignored complaints from companies, like those hosting
large conventions regularly at the Moscone Center, who threatened to take their
conferences elsewhere if San Francisco didn't fix its safety problems. After
all, convention attendees shouldn't have to navigate between tents on public
sidewalks or painstakingly avoid stepping into used needles.

The situation now is that although tourists are slowly returning to the city,
the vacancy rate of offices has not significantly improved. The Fentanyl crisis
raging in downtown San Francisco, especially in the adjacent Tenderloin
district, has made the decades-long homelessness crisis even worse. It
will take years, if not decades, to see structural change. As of recently,
the city has been relying on superficial improvements and enhancements like 
building a central skatepark as mentioned below.

<pic images/apec-fence-bike.ps Your USArundbrief reporters exploring the situation behind the fence.>

For the APEC conference (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation), which took place
mid-November at the Moscone Center in downtown San Francisco, this machinery
was running at full speed and was already taking on almost grotesque forms. San
Francisco was not only expecting high-ranking diplomats but also US President
Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in the city. As is customary when guests
are expected, everything was spruced up and polished like there's no tomorrow.
In the process, many issues were swept under the rug - all good, as long
as the dirt wasn't visible anymore.
This brings back memories of my teenage years when I used to stash everything
away into my wardrobe so that my room looked neat and tidy.

<pic images/apec-moscone.ps The conference took place at the Moscone Center, which was sealed off.>

TODO

The officials in San Francisco not only ensured that Biden and Xi Jinping did not see tents with homeless people. Even the graffiti disappeared overnight, there were no more garbage cans lying on the street and even the streetlights got a new coat of paint. Due to the strict security measures, they then fenced off the entire area around the Moscone Center without further ado. The population of San Francisco was puzzled as to how it could be that the city is suddenly cleaned up when high-ranking politicians come to town, but no one else cares.

"The laughable charade of our governor, Gavin Newsom."<LINK>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u07HdmSNQXA|Press conference|Press conference of Gavin Newsom</LINK>Oh, they're just cleaning up this place because all those fancy leaders are coming to town. That's true, because it's true. But then we laughed. Apparently it was already about cleaning up in San Francisco before the conference.

@Z: "Island in the Bay: Treasure Island"

<pic images/ti-map.ps The two islands in the middle of the Baybridge.>

<em>Michael</em>Driving from San Francisco with the car to the east, i.e. towards Oakland, the heavily frequented freeway I-80 leads over the Bay Bridge. The bridge consists of two sections: the western section that leaves San Francisco and the eastern section that connects to the other side of the bay in Emeryville. Exactly in the middle lie the two sections of the overall seven-kilometer-long bridge on an island in the bay, called "Yerba Buena Island". This mini-island is also connected to another island named "Treasure Island" via a short bridge road that leads over the water at sea level (image #4).

<pic images/treas-aerial.ps (#4) Above: Yerba Buena Island, Below: Treasure Island>

On Yerba Buena Island there used to be a fishing village of the then-residing Ohlohne Indians in the Bay Area. Around 1870 (i.e., after the Gold Rush) the military seized the island and since 1936, the Bay Bridge has been using it as a midway stop. For an exhibition called "Golden Gate International Exposition" held in 1939, city planners had the idea to fill in the shallow area north of Yerba Buena and created the artificial island known as "Treasure Island."

<pic images/ti-bike-lady.ps Viewpoint with panoramic view of the San Francisco skyline.>

Treasure Island officially belongs to the city of San Francisco, but so far only welfare recipients and government employees have lived in the squalid row houses located there. In addition, the ground is completely contaminated due to deposits from when the island was used as a military training ground. Anyone who wants to rent a residence there must contractually waive the risk.

<pic images/ti-housing.ps Old projects are standing on contaminated ground.>

Recently, the eastern part of the Bay Bridge had to be demolished and rebuilt anew in order to make it secure against earthquakes. Local bicyclists took advantage of this opportunity and succeeded in having not only four lanes per direction built but also a separated bike path constructed on the newly built section.

<pic images/ti-a-bridge.ps One can ride a bicycle from Emeryville to the Bay Bridge.>

Since shortly after the bridge renovation was completed in 2013, one can ride a bike or walk from the small town of Emeryville, which borders Oakland, onto the bridge on the east side. Skateboards and rollerblades are prohibited, however! At the western end of the eastern section, though, that was a wrap - the path down to the island was blocked due to construction. That lasted until 2016, but since then, the entire eastern portion of the path is now complete. One can ride a bike from Emeryville in approximately 30 minutes (it takes about two hours to walk) up onto the bike and pedestrian path, and then down the island.

<pic images/ti-exit.ps "Little trust-inspiring bicycle paths on Yerba Buena">

The bicycle path on the south side of the eastern part of the Bay Bridge leads to Yerba Buena Island in the west after a steep descent. From there, you can reach Treasure Island in just a few minutes by crossing over a steep hill on the access road. Not only are there old military barracks there, but also cute bungalows, football fields, a whiskey distillery and several good restaurants.

For knowledgeable car drivers, the island has actually always been accessible, provided that you take the appropriate exit at the tunnel in the middle of the bridge. A secret tip for our tourists! With the now complete bicycle path from Emeryville to Treasure Island, bike rental companies should now consider renting out hourly guided tours, which has been successful in the city for years. As always, I am ahead of my time.

<pic images/ti-housing-new.ps New apartment blocks on the island offer living space.>

The city of San Francisco has big plans for Treasure Island: As the City Council decided over 12 years ago, there will be housing for 19,000 residents, most of them in unattractive apartment blocks modeled on Vancouver. Furthermore, due to the limited space in our city because of its peninsular form, calls for more accommodation are growing louder, as this is supposed to bring rents down - which, of course, is sheer nonsense. However, we are used to such fantasies in San Francisco.

@Z: German Christmas market in Mountain View

<pic images/gsmvxmas-crowd.ps Poetic atmosphere at the German School's Christmas market in Mountain View.>

<em>Angelika</em>Michael always calls me Christmas mouse. I stand for that, I find Christmas great with everything that belongs to it. That has actually always been like that. I love decorating the apartment for Christmas. Even in the bathroom we have Christmas decorations. I always make my own Advent wreath and there is a candle here and there is a candle there. That's how I want it, that's how it has to be. And of course, a real Christmas tree cannot be missing.

In the United States, many people also celebrate Christmas, but since the population is diverse, other important holidays like Chanukka are also celebrated. In public institutions such as public schools, it is better to refrain from putting certain holidays of religious origin at the center, as the American Constitution stipulates a separation between church and state. Of course, there are always grey areas.

This year I am fully into the Christmas spirit thanks to my job at the "Deutsche Schule". There were Advent calendars and Advent wreaths in every classroom. The children tore open little doors and made stars out of the beautiful gold foil paper that I remember from my childhood days. I heard traditional songs like "Kling Gl√∂ckchen" and "Schneefl√∂ckchen, Weihnachtspykn√∂ssern", but also the earworm "In der Weihnachtsb√§ckerei" by Rolf Zuckowski or English songs such as "Up on the Housetop".

<pic images/gsmvxmas-schmuck.ps Craftsmanship also found favor with stands.>

The absolute highlight was, however, the school Christmas market which took place on 9 December. The proceeds of the market go to the school. Initially, I thought there would be a few stalls with handmade items but I was wrong. The market was just like a German Christmas market in terms of size and range of goods on offer. There was gluhwein, bratwurst, Christmas decorations from the Ore Mountains, gingerbread, Stollen, jewellery, craftwork. I couldn't believe it. The market is completely organised by volunteers from the school and the festive treats are actually imported by ship container from Germany. The market has been running for over 10 years and unfortunately had to be cancelled last year due to a severe storm and was also affected by the Coronavirus pandemic two years earlier.

<pic images/gsmvxmas-ambooth.ps The frantic circular letter reporters sell gingerbread.>

This year the atmosphere was so lively. The sun shone from the sky, and everything went great. The market took place on the town square in Mountain View, which is where our school is located. It was bustling with activity and people were standing in line for gluhwein and bratwurst like crazy. Even Michael and I volunteered to work a shift at the sweets and baked goods stand. We sold chocolate sticks, dominoes, speculaas, printen, and more. We could hardly keep up with customers. It was great fun and by the end of the day, almost everything had been sold.

@Z: "Flowers against wild camping"

<pic images/tent-division.ps Flowers should stop wild boars from wandering around.>

<em>Michael</em>Unfortunately, the city of San Francisco's administration is unable to prevent wild campers from occupying the sidewalks of the city with their tents. Wild camping, of course, is illegal, but timid city councilors are hesitant to take action to address the issue.

<pic images/tb-planters-close.ps Everything sealed with flower pots>

Embellished residents had however some time ago the idea to install massive flower boxes on the sidewalks in front of their homes, which is indeed also illegal, but the city council notoriously shies away from any conflict and therefore refrained from taking any action against this countermovement either.

<pic images/tb-mech.ps This auto workshop must tolerate the sidewalk cracking.>

The system seems to be working, since besides the over two meters long and almost one meter wide aluminum exteriors, which I call flower vases, each of which costs over 200 dollars, there is no room left for tents. However, it appears that the floral citizen patrol awaits the city's next eviction of tents, removal of mounds of dirt, and cleaning of sidewalks to set up more flower vases in night and fog operations. The wild tents grumble and move on to a few streets where sidewalks are still unbuilt.

<pic images/tb-bus-stop.ps "So remain bus stops tent-free.">

By now these flower bushes spread like mushrooms from the ground, the manufacturer must set records. When driving through our neighboring district of Mission, which is almost overgrown with tents, one can already see hundreds of these flower bushes on the sidewalks. Sometimes they even stand in closed areas, presumably as material for the next night and fog operation.

<pic images/tb-planter.ps Wild campers keep a distance from wildflowers.>

That must be tasted on the tongue: While the city, for example, mercilessly punishes wrong parkers, it fails to prevent the Zelter from blocking the sidewalks for pedestrians. Even wheelchair users have to move onto the street to avoid the street vendors, the Moll and unattended fighting dogs. The fact that no one has yet filed a lawsuit for non-compliance with California's very strict accessibility regulations surprises me honestly. Or maybe not. And the solution is that taxpaying citizens buy flower pots at their own expense to restore human conditions.

<pic images/tb-trash.ps The residents are upset about the pile of trash on the sidewalk.>
<pic images/folsom-fire.ps The San Francisco Fire Department had to go out at midnight to put out this tent fire.>

And naturally, so-called homeless advocates immediately protested against the flower boxes as...<LINK>https://sfstandard.com/2023/09/21/san-francisco-planters-dubbed-hostile-architecture-what-locals-say|Homeless-hostile architecture</LINK>And the flowerpot shaped vases as heartless pranksters attacked. However, it seems that the squirrels are carelessly handling their fire sites, because fires accumulate that burn trees and adjacent houses, fortunately San Francisco has a well-functioning fire department.

@Z: "San Francisco Civic Center Plaza" in English.

<pic images/skater-city-hall.ps The market had to give way, now the plaza is a skate park.>

<em>Angelika</em>Many of San Francisco's problems are homemade and have accumulated over years. For example, there is no opposition on the city council. All members belong to the Democratic Party, and they actually differ only in terms of how progressive they are. At first glance, one might think that a council that is firmly in the hands of a party would receive a lot of pressure, but unfortunately, this is not the case. On the contrary: The most absurd ideas are being implemented, and there are no opposing voices to insist on checking whether the measures actually work or just waste money.

The redesign of the City Hall plaza (specifically a portion of the UN Plaza) in the city center is quite a questionable project. You should know that the "City Hall", or the San Francisco city hall, borders on a rather seedy neighborhood called the Tenderloin. Since we have lived here, drug dealers have been selling on the plaza in front of the city hall. Loyal newsletter readers may remember that I worked in the Tenderloin for many years. During my active time in the neighborhood, there were a lot of undercover cops (undercover cops) who caught drug dealers and then arrested them.

Then the city policy entered into a critical phase where drug dealers were simply allowed to operate freely, because supposedly they are just poor dogs that cannot be arrested, no matter how many victims they cause through the drug trade. However, the fentanyl crisis has resulted in San Francisco having more drug-related deaths than coronavirus deaths even during pandemic times, and the numbers of drug-related deaths have continued to rise even after the pandemic. So far in 2023, there have been<LINK>https://abc7news.com/san-francisco-record-overdose-deaths-fentanyl-wastewater-drug-testing/14186379|"752 Fillmore Street in San Francisco"</LINK>Most died from a fentanyl overdose.

<pic images/ccenter-wheel.ps "Wheelchair Willy was always a regular at the Civic Center.">

There are elections in the city next year and there is a growing sense of panic among politicians because many residents of San Francisco have become increasingly frustrated with their politicians' laissez-faire attitude. As a result, they are currently engaged in a lot of activism, inspired by the motto "Our city needs to be more beautiful." In the context of this program, UN Plaza, a part of the city hall plaza, recently received two million dollars worth of cosmetic surgery. The city council decided it was time to evict the drug dealers from the plaza and chose to build a small skatepark instead. Additionally, there are table tennis tables, foosball tables, and some fitness machines available for public use, as well as Zumba classes. At first glance, there is nothing wrong with this, but I don't quite understand why a skatepark would scare away drug dealers.

<pic images/skater-home.ps After skateboarding, we go home again.>

And then there's another problem. For over 40 years, a weekly market has been held twice a week on the "UN Plaza" in front of City Hall. This is an important source of fresh produce at reasonable prices for residents of the Tenderloin neighborhood, as there is no supermarket in the area. The market had to move due to renovation and is now located on the other side of the "UN Plaza." However, the temporary location is much smaller, so many vendors have had to reduce their stalls. They were not enthusiastic about not being consulted on the redesign plans. Furthermore, they cannot park their vans behind their stands anymore and must now park them further away, which is a high risk in a city where car windows are broken instantly if even a cable is visible inside. This would be a problem that needs to be addressed, but as mentioned, only superficial improvements are being made before the elections.

@Z: Register at the city library

<pic images/sfpl-presidio.ps The grand branch library of San Francisco, Presidio.>

<em>Michael</em>Who would have known that there is a public library in San Francisco with 31 branches? The system of borrowing a book from the shelf of a musty public institution has been familiar to me since childhood in Germany. In San Francisco, I had not managed to obtain a library card in over twenty years, but now that I have some breathing room, I thought: let's try it out.

<pic images/sfpl-card.ps (#5) Michael's bookmark with cat motif>

I went to a branch of the San Francisco Public Library (SFPL) in our neighborhood on Jersey Street, showed my driver's license and said "What's a guy gotta do around here to get a library card?" or something similar, anyway I wanted to imitate Kramer from Seinfeld as much as possible. The lady behind the counter entered my details into the computer, confirmed that my address was in San Francisco and asked me what motivation I had on my four-year, free library card. Portraits of any left-wing political heroes maybe? I decided to go with the cute cat motif (Picture #5).

In an impromptu briefing, I learned that the loan period for books is three weeks and one can extend it five times (if not another bookworm has reserved the book with a so-called "Hold"). Also, the maximum number of books that a person can borrow at the same time surprised me: up to 100 books! A shopping cart is even provided to bring them all. Returning the books can be done in any (!) branch, either by placing them on the librarian's table or by dropping them into the mailbox downstairs.

<pic images/sfpl-noe.ps Even in our district there is a branch of the city library.>

Most of the books in the branch are old cheese, not even classic American novelists, rather like the grab bag of the bookstore. An exception is the shelf labeled "Lucky Day," where new releases from the book-tycoon can be found. There one can find (with luck) biographies about Elon Musk, or that quack book by Prince Harry, or even the latest New York Times bestsellers like "Chip Wars." However, one cannot extend the loan period of these sought-after books.

<pic images/sfpl-obama.ps In the section "Lucky Day," the library features new releases.>

I have already borrowed myself a few copies and was very satisfied. Books that you can of course buy for $20, but a man like me has to count the pennies! Moreover, it forces one to adhere to the deadline, I do not read quickly and a book with 300 pages in three weeks is already quite strenuous for me.

<pic images/libby-add.ps (#8) With one button press, Libby sends the book to your Kindle.>

There's also a DVD rack, but who watches DVDs these days? And of course, even in the city library, progress has been made with digital books. Highly recommended! With the "Libby" app on your smartphone, you can choose your library and download a book that the library can lend a limited number of copies. Then wipe it off twice and press it, and the book will appear in Amazon's Kindle universe (#8), where you can read it with any Kindle reader. For three weeks.

<pic images/libby-ended.ps (#7) After the loan period has expired, the book will be withdrawn.>

After the three-week deadline has expired, then Libby and then Amazon will take back the eBook again (Illustration #7)! You have to imagine this: To adhere to the old concept of publishers from long ago that finance the production of a book through sold copies, the library must wrestle the digital copy from the reader who may not even be finished with it yet, so that too many copies are not in circulation. I had to press the emergency shutdown button on the network to be able to read the last pages in peace. We live in strange times.

@Z: "Travel bread knife from Victorinox"

<pic images/vic-cut.ps The knife cuts through bread like butter.>

<em>Michael</em>One day I will write a comprehensive guide on typical AirBnB accommodations and their lack of home accessories. Clothes hangers, for example. Where do you hang your jacket besides the apartment door when there is no appropriate hook available? Or in general storage space. According to my planned compendium "Now we are setting up our AirBnB apartment," there should always be a small table or shelf in the entrance area, or perhaps a shelf that provides space for utensils that one should always have at hand in a foreign residence: keys, wallets or phones and their chargers.

<pic images/vic-drawer.ps Typical Airbnb kitchen setup: No bread knife>

A common problem with this type of accommodation is the absence of sharp knives. You have bought fresh bread and want to cut it in your rented apartment, but you have to make do with a dull kitchen knife and ruin the whole lovely bread. That doesn't have to be!

<pic images/vic-order.ps The knife can be had for $24 on Amazon.>

Okay, Americans laugh naturally about my problems, because they buy their bread in 99 percent of all cases already cut. But also for other food products a sharp knife pays off, but one can not take monster knives with on travel without causing a stir at the airport, besides one must always wrap the sharp edges up to avoid an accident.

<pic images/vic-fold.ps Securely folded for transport>

One day I stumbled upon Amazon over the Victorinox Firma Klappbrotmesser, the well-known Swiss Matador of the art of kitchen knives. The knife is not long, the blade is only 11cm long, probably due to some safety regulations so that lunatics do not misuse it. However, since the blade snaps shut in the open position and the cutting edge is very sharp, you can easily slice through fresh bread with murder crust without even a crumb falling off, and the slices will look appetizingly clean after that. The piece is missing from us on no more journey. Top product! @Z: Postboxes need security upgrades

<pic images/usps-mb-wide.ps In the past, one could easily insert envelopes into mailboxes with a flap.>

<em>Michael</em>The blue mailboxes of the American Post differed from the yellow German ones in that one could insert letters and even small parcels by opening a relatively large flap at the top, placing the mail or parcel inside, and snapping the flap shut, launching it into the interior. However, this is now history!<LINK>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/nyregion/mailbox-theft-fishing.html|"Finding Criminal from the New York Bronx | Post-Theft"</LINK>Years ago, people started putting sticky insect traps on fishing lines inside, and letters like Mrs. Bolt's bratwurst letterbox out to catch.

<pic images/usps-mailbox-letter.ps Finally, only narrow letters go into secure slits.>

This trend now appears to have arrived in increasingly disorderly San Francisco, with complaints from postal customers indicating that mailbox theft is on the rise. In response, the United States Postal Service was forced to replace the old blue mailboxes with newer, more secure ones. Instead of a drop-off slot, these new mailboxes have a narrow opening that is secured by metal teeth and can only be used for depositing mail. This technology was previously known only from mailboxes belonging to wealthy urbanites and slot-type bank safes in Germany.

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/usps-post-office.ps "Little packet now only accepts the post office.">
</HTMLONLY>

After the theft of mail was relatively rare until a few years ago, it has always been considered a federal crime. If a mail thief is caught, it is not necessarily a local prosecutor who takes action, but rather a more stringent federal official, and the offense is tried in a federal court. However, the federal authorities seem to be less willing in recent times to investigate such offenses, and in some cases, even

Therefore, the bill remains with the ordinary citizen who previously could insert smaller packages into the mailbox and now must travel to the next post office for every padded envelope.

<pic images/mailbox.ps (#2) A burglar broke into our rental house's mailbox.>

Even in our rental house, the mail thieves had already struck: One night in November, they broke into the intercom system, opened the front door and then lifted the letter box, for which only the postal worker has the master key (Illustration #2). The property management quickly had everything repaired. A report was made to the police, but it is highly likely that nothing will come of it due to too much bureaucracy and too little prospect of success.

Leave the city under criticism.
