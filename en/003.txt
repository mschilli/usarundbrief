Hi there, friends!

<em>Angelika</em> A few weeks have gone by and I'm finally
ready to start my third newsletter. Michael has been in San Francisco for a
good six months now and I've been living here for almost five months. Despite
this time, life is still new and exciting for us, and we still enjoy
discovering the country and its people. We have also just overcome our first
major crisis.

@Z: Company in Financial Crisis

<em>Angelika</em>
Blaxxun, the company for which Michael works, has recently closed its office in
San Francisco. But I have to give some background information, otherwise nobody
will understand me.

First of all, one must know that Blaxxun is funded by an American investor,
both the office in Munich and the office in San Francisco. Since Blaxxun is a
relatively new and small company and develops completely new software, the
financial situation is not as secure as with global companies such as Siemens
or Microsoft (Michael would now be pulling his hair out at my examples, since
he is not exactly a fan of these companies). In plain language, this means that
it needs to turn a profit at some point. Unfortunately, Americans are not
currently interested in the things that Blaxxun develops; the Germans, however,
are. So the American sponsor decided on the spot that the office in San
Francisco would be closed and all his hopes would be placed on the office in
Munich. The consequence is that all employees in San Francisco were dismissed
on May 15th. For us, this would have meant that we would have had to pack our
bags immediately (and I had just finished unpacking everything and hanging the
pictures on the wall), since our residence permit and Michael's work permit are
completely linked to the company America.

<pic images/homeoff.ps Michael gives the evil eye because he was interrupted while working.>

Now, you are probably wondering why we are still here. Don't worry, I'm getting
to it, I just wanted to make it a bit exciting. So, we have just been
incredibly lucky. Michael and his colleague Peter are the only ones still
working for the American company. This is possible because the American
headquarters still exists. The company in America now only has two employees
instead of 30. The finances are secured until the beginning of 1998, but since
there are some projects running in Germany, it is very likely to be even
longer. So, if you were paying close attention, you are probably wondering
where Michael is working now since there is no office in San Francisco anymore.
The office is now, so to speak, in our apartment, i.e. Michael is working from
home. You can imagine it like this: in our bedroom there is a huge desk with
two computers and an additional laptop. I really hope that we don't get in each
other's way in our small apartment, but as long as we can stay here and I don't
have to play Michael's secretary, I'm fine with it.

Michael will now calmly wait out the situation. Everyone of course hopes that
the company will make a big breakthrough. But if the situation continues to
worsen, Michael will try to find a new job here in San Francisco. That is
not easy though. There is plenty of work, but a new company would have to
obtain a new work permit for Michael, which can take two months. An American
company is usually used to the new employee being able to start immediately due
to the lack of notice periods. It doesn't help that Michael has already worked
here. The case would be treated completely new again. Long live bureaucracy!!!!

I hope you were able to follow my somewhat lengthy explanations and for those
who found my explanations too long, I will quickly write Michael's brief
summary of the situation: "Everything remains the same, except now I can even
work from my bed!"

Despite having more luck than sense in hindsight, the situation was still quite
stressful. The problem is that you can lose everything along with your job
here, health insurance being the most critical part. As a foreigner, Michael
wouldn't have been able to get unemployment benefits anyway, and even for
Americans it's barely enough to get by. We really wouldn't have had any other
choice than to go back to Germany, and we didn't want to do that because we had
just settled in. A sure sign that we had become real Californians is, for
example, that we had already slept through the last minor earthquake of
magnitude 3.4 and only heard about it because my friend Sylvi called in a state
of excitement to ask if we had noticed anything and if we were all right.

@Z: Vacation on Kauai/Hawaii

<pic images/strand.ps At the beach on Kauai.>

<em>Angelika</em>
After these uncertain and exciting times, we spontaneously decided to fly to
Hawaii for a week. We had chosen the island of Kauai, as it is not so touristy.
And it was really paradise: long white sand beaches, great weather, an ocean
with warm water and good waves, lush green vegetation, a fantastic landscape, a
nice hotel and friendly islanders. Michael of course tried surfing, but failed
at the waves, which frustrated him especially since the twelve-year-old boys
took the waves with ease. I, on the other hand, was glad that I didn't have to
call David Hasselhof from Baywatch to rescue him. And I tell you, it sometimes
looked pretty dangerous when Michael was thrown around by the waves.

@Z: Immigrant Musings

<em>Angelika</em>
Yesterday my first English course ended with a celebration. Since 95% of the course
participants were Latin Americans, it was quite a party! We danced to hot rhythms
and nobody stayed seated. The course had not only helped me to learn English, but I
also learned a lot about other countries and what life is like as an immigrant
in the USA. To give you a small sample of what we did in the course, I'm
sending you two texts that were published in our college newspaper. We had the
task to write about our dreams. One text is from me and one from a classmate
from Nicaragua. Maria's text also shows well how life can be here as an
immigrant and with what different experiences and ideas everyone comes to the
USA.

My Dream -- by Maria B.

A 15 year-old dating a U.S. citizien in Nicaragua? Oh, yes! 
How we dream when we are 15! I had a yellow moon, shining 
stars and red hearts. I had a marriage, a white picket 
fence, a pink and blue pastel-colored home, some children, 
all the necessities of life. It didn't matter where -- here 
in the US or in Nicaragua. I had the perfect, loving, 
hard-working husband, the perfect, well-cared-for house, 
the perfect income, the perfect children -- and the perfect 
me: the wife, mother, housekeeper. Yes, everything! 
 ... A dream ...
Well! I got married to that old windbag, had 
two children. After a lot of trouble, I found out my 
mother-in-law did not like the idea of what had already 
happened with her son (a 48 year-old by this time). Well, 
no step back! He brought us to San Francisco -- two baby 
girls and me. By this time I was nearly 18. My first 
address was his mother's house. It was pure hell: a 
possessive mother who did not have one millimeter of 
desire to share her son with anyone and the man who enjoyed 
every bit of this relationship and the situation that 
brought such disastrous consequences to my children and 
me, because this man cared more about his egocentrism than 
the family he had created. My children and I almost 
drowned in the rage of jealousy and selfishness of these 
two people. Well, today -- 20 years later -- my children are 
alive, married, each one with two children. My daughter 
and I are still dealing with the painful consequences of 
the past. It seperates us; and, as a result I cannot see my 
grandchildren. Today my pain has been eased by the death of 
the mother-in-law and the adulthood of my children and the 
relief of having done the best I could. Well, as for me, I 
will grow. Now I have come into a new era of life. I'm 
taking classes in Introduction to Computers and
English as a second language, and I'm finishing my
General Education Degree, which I'm about to get. 

And here's my text:

My Dream -- by Angelika Schilli

Thinking about a very special 
dream of mine, a lot of different things come to my mind; 
for example, to live in an old Victorian house at the 
beach, to study medicine, to write a famous book or to be 
a popular photographer. Although some of these dreams are 
very unrealistic, it is good to have them, because perhaps 
some day a dream will come true. You never know. So I like 
to play with my imagination; for example, if I go to the 
beach, I'll look for a niece place for my dream house. If I 
read a book, I'll think about my own book. But most of 
all, I want to be a photographer. I love to take pictures, 
so you often see me with a camera wandering around and 
looking for a good subject. It's the play of the light and 
the colors that are fascinating to me. In my opinion, a 
picture tells you a lot about the feelings of the person 
who took the picture. That means you can express your 
feelings with a photo. When I came to San Francisco, the 
first thing I did was to take pictures of my new 
neighborhood. I've learned a lot with the help of my camera 
about my new surroundings. For me, San Francisco is a very 
good place for photography. It's a colorful city with 
interesting people and dramatic views. So in a way my dream 
to be a photographer has come true. I'm not a famous one, 
but I can enjoy my hobby every day, and the pictures I've 
taken will always be a memory of my time in San Franciso.

@Z: Speaking English and Comprehension Skills

<em>Angelika</em>
With respect to speaking the language, many people keep asking me if my English
is already perfect.  I would say that many things are easier for me now (e.g.
making phone calls), as I understand more complicated things and I don't have
to think so long when I want to say something. Nevertheless, I still come
across my language limits, especially when it comes to having a conversation at
a higher level. It is also quite difficult to be funny in another language.
However, I think this is normal; after all, I have been speaking German for
much longer than English. What I have noticed is that many things I learned in
school come back to me (e.g.  grammar). I can also write short texts quite well
again. Speaking, however, is still the hardest part for me, but it was like
that in school already. Another big problem is that I often don't dare or want
to express things too complicated. Well, I still have a lot of time to
practice. Starting Monday, I will attend a four-week English summer course at
my City College and then everything will be closed here due to the summer
break. Starting June 26th I will be visiting in Germany. I will first land in
Munich and stay there until July 5th. From July 5th to 22nd I will be in
Oldenburg. So if anyone wants to see me, remember these dates.

Of course, this newsletter wouldn't be complete without a few comments on
everyday life in America:

@Z: Tipping

<em>Angelika</em>
First off, there's the always puzzling topic of tipping. If you travel to the United States, you
should always be carrying a bundle of one-dollar bills with you, as the bellhop at
the hotel, the housekeeper, etc. will make sure that this bundle keeps shrinking as
quickly as possible. But it is also an absolute sin not to give a tip. This is
because, for example, the waiter or hairdresser earn such a low base salaries
that they cannot survive without the additional tip. So, if the service is good,
which is usually the case in America, you give at least a 15% tip, if the service
is great, even 20%.

I tell you, in America they rely on the good old mental arithmetic when it
comes to tipping. In California, there is a very simple trick, since the sales
tax (i.e. what is called value-added tax in Germany) is 7.5%, you just have to
double the sales tax and you have already calculated your 15% tip. But beware;
since the tax in each US state is different (e.g. in Hawaii it is only 3%), you
cannot blindly apply this trick everywhere. The sales tax gets always added to
the purchase price when you're paying for something, which leads to the
situation that you struggle to calculate the exact amount required and thus
never have the right change ready, which means you walk around with a lot of
small change that you can't get rid of for the reasons mentioned above.

@Z: Seasonal Sales

<em>Angelika</em>
Regarding sales, there is another natural law, namely that there are
always some special offers and something like clearance sales happening, which
then have the funniest names and occasions. Macy's department store, for
example, has the so-called "White Flower Sale" at regular intervals. It is not,
as the name suggests, white flowers on special offer, but all sorts of things.
I still haven't found out if the name has a deeper meaning. Americans are
quite inventive in general to attract or retain customers. If you buy certain
things in a store again and again, you get something like bonus points. For
example, I get a stamp for every greeting card I buy at my stationery store.
When I have collected 25 stamps, I get a 5 dollar discount on my next card
purchase. But I find the coupons the funniest. These are usually found in
brochures that come with the daily newspaper or you get entire coupon booklets in
the mail. A coupon usually applies to a certain product, e.g.
Colgate toothpaste. If you present the coupon at the supermarket checkout when
you shop there next, you will also get a discount or you will be encouraged to buy
two tubes of toothpaste to get one free. There are really the most wonderful variations.

@Z: Anti Smoking Campaigns

<pic images/smoke.ps Anti Smoking Advertisement>

<em>Angelika</em>
Another inexhaustible topic here is still the topic of "smoking", which has now
developed into a real war between smokers and non-smokers. Smoking has long
been prohibited in public buildings such as airports, as well as in offices.
That, I think, is still comparable to German conditions. But now there are no
longer any smoking areas in restaurants, which means that smoking is no longer
allowed anywhere food is served. Smokers can only escape to bars or the street,
but in San Francisco, attempts have already been made to prohibit smoking in
bars as well, which has caused smokers and some more liberal non-smokers to
protest, so that the ban has not yet been enforced. Some politicians are even
seriously discussing banning smoking on the street. Meanwhile, there are even
various counter ads to tobacco advertising, such as a poster with the Marlboro
cowboys, where one tells the other about his lung edema. Smokers in San
Francisco are usually nowadays only seen standing in hidden corners. This often
reminds me of teenagers smoking secretly. Although I am a non-smoker myself and
enjoy the clean air in restaurants very much, I am amused by the vehemence with
which the topic is being discussed.

Lawsuits for damages have been brought against cigarette manufacturers because
smokers have become ill. I think this is a bit exaggerated, since no one is
forced to smoke. In general, I cannot understand how in a country where there
are huge protests when the freedom to bear arms is to be restricted, on the
other hand, smokers are almost treated like second-class citizens, who will
bring us certain death. I would even say that here more people become victims
of a weapon than victims of passive smoking. With regard to weapons, the old
cowboy mentality seems to prevail again. And to conclude this topic, here is a
quote from the pilot during our landing in San Francisco after our trip to Las
Vegas. He informed us that smoking is not allowed in San Francisco. Of course,
he meant only the airport, although his statement hit the nail on the head. So,
these were today's everyday stories. Before I end the letter, I would like to
entertain you with two more things:

@Z: Golfing

<em>Angelika</em>
First off, I have to report that Michael discovered golfing. That's of course
because golf is a sport for everyone here and doesn't cost astronomical amounts to play.
Anyway, he now goes golfing every week and loves it. Last week he came back
with calluses on his hands. Now he's trying to get me to play too, but I'm not
quite sure how to feel about it yet. I just don't understand what's so great
about shooting a ball across a green field and eventually putting it into a
hole. To each its own!

@Z: Glide Memorial Church

<em>Angelika</em>
Finally, I would like to tell you briefly about our visit to the Glide Memorial
Church in San Francisco. The church is located in a rather poor neighborhood.
But that didn't stop us from going there one Sunday. And you
really can't imagine what the service was like. First of all, they had an exalted
gospel choir singing, while the worshipers clapped and danced to the rhythm. The black
pastor's sermon was interrupted several times by enthusiastic interjections
such as "Amen" or "Yes, he is right!" and was also quite lively and modern. The
worshipers had all kinds of skin colors, came from different educational
backgrounds and religions and every age was represented. I'm not sure if
everyone would like this kind of "show", but we felt comfortable. All of San
Francisco was represented in the service, which Michael and I especially like:
"Liberal, lively, colorful!" By the way, the congregation is not only known for
its extravagant services but also for its social engagement. Since the
neighborhood in which the church is located has a very severe problems with
homelessness, drugs and violence, the congregation not only provides three
meals a day to up to 3,500 people, but also has a day care center for children,
computer courses to improve job prospects, programs to battle drugs and AIDS,
projects to reduce violence in families, etc. The congregation works a lot with
volunteers (up to 5,000 per year) and I am strongly considering signing up for
the pre-school area, where children from difficult families are cared for
daily. But first of all, my visit to Germany is coming up.

So, now I have reported enough. We are thinking of you!

With love!
