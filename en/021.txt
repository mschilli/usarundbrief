@Z: The History of California

<pic images/stb2.ps At Big Sur>

<em>Michael</em> 
My dear schoolchildren,
Today we have Special Studies Counselor Michael as a guest, who will
exceptionally be teaching our history class. Quiet! Shhhh! Hey,
listen ... you bunch! I'll send you all to the principal! There you
go! No nonsense, or I'll hand out reprimands! I'll sort you out!

Good morning, dear children! Good morning, Mr. Special Studies
Counselor! Hehehe ... well, my dears, today we will explore the
question of what the Californian cities of San Francisco, San Diego,
San Mateo, San Carlos, Santa Clara, San Jose, San Rafael, San Miguel,
San Antonio, and Santa Barbara have in common. So, what stands out?
Yes, you there, with the long hair in the last row! They say long
hair, short mind! Yes? Yes? Oh, in vain ... well, dear children,
these are all names of religious figures: Saint Anthony, Saint
Joseph, Saint Charles, you get the picture, as Americans says.

<pic images/missions2.ps The missions along the California coast>

And all of this happened around the year 1600, when the Spaniards boarded
ships to conquer the world. They sailed around and came up with the
idea of settling on the American continent. By 1700, they had taken a
liking to Mexico, and they called the strip of the west coast there
"Baja California" (pronounced "Bacha Kalifornia"), meaning "Lower
California." Then, around 1770, they turned their attention to the
more northern areas, including what is now California, which the
Spanish gentlemen and ladies called "Alta California" (Upper
California). From San Diego up to San Francisco, they established
missions at every corner to convert the Native Americans. Believe it
or not, where we live today in San Francisco, the Ohlone Indians
lived 250 years ago. They subsisted on berries, seaweed, and fish, if
I can believe the history book I recently bought. Honestly, personally, I would
prefer a decent hamburger. And occasionally, they had geese, which,
according to the book, were called "Laklak" in the Ohlone language.

All these missions, most of which came with a so-called
"Presidio," a type of barracks for the Spanish soldiers, were
connected by a road called "El Camino Real" (The King's Road). The El
Camino Real began north of San Francisco, went through the city, and
still continues today under its original name further south through
the small towns of Silicon Valley and extends beyond Los Angeles and
San Diego down to the current Mexican border. So, if you have lots
of time and don't mind stopping at every traffic light, you can drive
from San Francisco to the Mexican border on the former El Camino
Real. Back in the day, California was still part of Mexico; it wasn't until
1848 that the USA seized the land in the Mexican-American War and
never gave it back. That's why there are still plenty of streets with
Spanish names around here today, such as the "Alameda de las Pulgas," which
means "Street of the Fleas," where cows and sheep and other livestock
were driven. In fact, I used to ride this street daily on my bicycle
in San Mateo before I worked at Netscape in Mountain View.

"So, that's it from the cheerful world of Silicon Valley, dear
children! Take care, it's been an honor!" "Goodbye, Mr. Special
Studies Counselor!" "Hehehe ..."

@Z: Santa Barbara

<pic images/stb1.ps On the way to Santa Barbara>

<em>Michael</em> 
Why am I telling you this? In March, we took the opportunity to travel on a
long weekend again, this time heading down to Santa Barbara, almost
near Los Angeles. We zoomed south along Highway 1 along the coast,
past Big Sur and through San Luis Obispo (where, by the way, there is
an excellent inn that brews its own beer and offers a dish called
"Braumeister," which consists of two beef sausages with sauerkraut,
yum!) covering the 300 miles with a rental car. Unfortunately,
it was raining cats and dogs in Santa Barbara, and the main thing to
report from there is that we had a funny experience in a restaurant.

<pic images/stb4.ps Mission church with paintings in Santa Barbara>

Surely, we have mentioned before that it is customary here to wait at
the restaurant entrance until the waiter assigns you a seat--this is
called "Wait to be seated." And you never sit at a table with people you
don't know; Americans prefer to have their own space. This, of
course, leads to long lines of diners forming in front of the
restaurant entrance, especially in the early evening hours, and you
might end up waiting half an hour before it's your turn. Usually,
there is a waiting list where you are registered (with your first
name!), and when the waiter shouts "Mike! Party of two!" you may
proceed to the assigned table and finally eat.

Of course, in our fast paced times, developments never stop, and modern
restaurants present themselves as progressive: You receive a small
"beeper," a little device about 2 by 3 inches in size, which
receives signals like a cordless phone and triggers an alarm when the
table becomes available. In a rather busy fish restaurant in Santa
Barbara, we were told it would take about 20 minutes for a table to
become available, and in exchange for handing over the car keys, we were
given a beeper.

<pic images/beeper.ps Without car key, but with beeper.>

We took the opportunity to walk along the beach, not knowing that the
beeper only had a range of about 300 feet. When we returned to the
restaurant after some time, the beeper started buzzing, and we
quickly went up the stairs to claim our table. However, the waitress
said we were too late; the alarm had gone off several times without
us showing up, and now our table had been given to someone else. We
were furious! In the end, we did get a table in the packed place, so
we were lucky. I had grilled shark, which was very tasty. I'll wholeheartedly
recommend the place: "Brophy Brothers" in Santa Barbara. But don't go too
far away with the beeper if you want a table!

@Z: Minimum wage and sweatshops

<pic images/gap1.ps Protests targeting GAP (1)>

<em>Michael</em> 
In Santa Barbara, it also happened that we were handed a flyer by protestors.
The clothing store GAP, a very well-known clothing chain in the USA, was
accused of employing people under unacceptable conditions. The title of the
leaflet was "GAP treats workers like slaves." The demonstrators said that GAP
employs Asian women on an island in the Pacific called "Saipan," which
supposedly belongs to the USA, who sew the clothing of the retail giant under
harsh conditions (12 hours a day, 7 days a week). I have no idea if this is
true; I just found it interesting because in the USA, unions have no power. If
the union at the parcel delivery service UPS organizes a strike once every 10
years (as happened a few years ago), it is already considered a sensation.
However, a law requires that the employer must pay at least a wage of $5.15 per
hour.

Pretty much everything else is voluntary: Most employers only contribute to
health insurance in higher level jobs. Angelika once knew someone who worked at one
of the big car rental companies. He reported that the people who receive or
wash the returning cars do not get health insurance provided by the company.
But if you climb further up the career ladder and serve customers at the
counter, the company pays the employee's contributions as a special bonus. I
just wanted to share the story with the flyer because in the GAP in San
Francisco, you always feel like you're at Stachus in Munich: Lots of German
tourists. I wouldn't be surprised if they soon start hiring German-speaking
salespeople. They would then have to take an extra course in being unfriendly,
talk to colleagues all day, and react annoyed if their conversation is
interrupted because someone can't find their pants size. You have to provide
people with their familiar environment!

<pic images/gap2.ps Protests against GAP (2)>

If you ever have a question like the one above ("What is the minimum
wage in the USA?"), I can recommend the virtual butler Jeeves on the
internet: Go to http://ask.com and type "What's the minimum wage?"
into the search field -- the helpful servant will show you the way to
the answer. It's really not bad, I often search there and usually
find what I'm looking for.

@Z: WebVan -- the grocery delivery service

<pic images/webvan.ps The WebVan in action>

<em>Michael</em> 
And here's something new from the internet: Since grocery shopping
isn't exactly one of the most interesting activities, even though the
stores are open day and night, weekdays and weekends, there's now a
new service to prevent the fridge from being empty: WebVan, the
internet delivery van, brings groceries directly to your home. Here's
how it works: On the website webvan.com, you can choose your items,
and there's more variety than even in the largest supermarket.
Personally, I always measure the size of a supermarket here using the
milk index I invented: How many different types of milk are there?
Not dairy products like yogurt and cottage cheese, but regular milk
in bottles or cartons. In Germany, there might be about 5. Here in
the USA, it's always 10-15. And at WebVan, I counted: 28.

<pic images/milch.ps A dozen of the 28 different types of milk available on webvan.com.>

And the best part is that the items are cheaper than in the
supermarket, even with delivery. After selecting your items on the
website, you proceed to checkout--still online--and choose when the
goods will be delivered, usually the next day. You can select a
half-hour time slot between seven in the morning and eight in the
evening (for example, 7:30 PM - 8:00 PM) when the WebVan guy comes by
with his delivery van, brings the items to your door, and spreads them out on
the kitchen table. Shopping is fun this way! (Editor's note: WebVan
went bankrupt in 2001, like many young companies in the internet
sector.)

@Z: Volkszählung

<pic images/census.ps The questionnaire for the 2000 census>

<em>Michael</em> 
We had a census recently: You have to know that the concept of a registration office
is as foreign to Americans as friendliness is to Germans. That's why,
for example, the city of San Francisco has no idea how many people
currently live there. When you move, you don't register or deregister
anywhere--you just move, and where from and to is nobody's business.
Now, of course, the city wants to know how many schools it needs to
build and which streetcar lines, and how much money needs to flow into the
individual districts--and for this, it relies on census data.
That's why the government distributes questionnaires every 10 years
that people have to fill out, and not just in San Francisco: Census
takers even reach the Eskimos in the far north of Alaska and register
every igloo, as was recently reported in the Süddeutsche Zeitung.

I still remember the last census in Germany. It must have been in the eighties.
Everyone was extremely upset -- but compared to the request we received here
recently, that was quite harmless. Although the data is anonymized, meaning it
is processed statistically so that no conclusions can be drawn about the
individual household affected, the questions were quite shocking to us: You not
only had to say how many people live in the household, but also specify their
ethnic origin: Black or white skin color, Latino, Asian, or Native American.
This is unusual because otherwise, great importance is placed on "politically
correct" (PC) treatment, meaning no one should be disadvantaged because of
their skin color or origin. For example, a job application to a local company
must not include a passport photo. An employer cannot base the decision to
invite a candidate for an interview on their ethnic origin. In a job interview,
you are not even allowed to ask which country the candidate comes from; that
would be illegal.

Angelika filled out the form without any complaints and sent it back.
The accompanying letter warned that if one did not do so, a reminder
would be sent, and a representative would come by to hopefully
collect the completed form. If one still did not comply, a
representative would show up after a certain period to "assist" with
filling it out. The image above shows the census form -- as always,
internet users have the advantage, as they can enlarge the image to
read it by clicking on it with the mouse. Traditional mail
recipients enlarge the image by soaking the circular in kerosene for
three weeks and then slowly pulling it apart with a trouser
stretcher.

@Z: Hairdressers in the USA

<em>Michael</em> 
And here's another story that's so bizarre it's hard to believe:
Anyone who has ever been to America knows that it's very difficult to
find a hairdresser who is actually capable of cutting hair. In
America, there is no direct "craft," anyone can call themselves a
hairdresser if they feel like it. Not like in Munich, where on
Friedenheimer Street a master of his craft wielded the scissors:
Master "Pablo" at "Design in Hair" -- probably unmatched in the whole
world -- yes, world! I had only been in San Francisco for a few weeks
when my head was craving a haircut, and I unsuspectingly went into a
random hair salon on 24th Street around the corner from us. After the
first 10 seconds in the chair, it became clear to me that the guy
cutting my hair had no idea what he was doing. It took me almost half
a year of disappointments, wandering from salon to salon, until I
finally, by chance, found a gentleman in the Italian quarter of San
Francisco who mastered the art of haircutting. Since I was working in
the Italian quarter (called North Beach) at the time, it was very
convenient; I would just go for a quick haircut during my lunch
break. Then I suddenly worked in San Mateo and finally in Mountain
View, but I still wanted to enjoy a good haircut -- so every six
weeks on Saturdays, I drove half an hour across the city to North
Beach to have my hair skillfully trimmed there. But, oh dear -- one
Saturday, there was a sign in the shop informing that the gentleman
was working at a place called "SF Hairport" over the weekend.
Grumbling, I drove home.

Now it happened that on the following Sunday, we were lingering at
the San Francisco airport because the SchÃ¶nkes, Angelika's parents,
were about to take their return flight home after a visit. I was
strolling past one of those airport hair salons, happened to glance
inside--and couldn't believe it: there sat my hairdresser from North
Beach! Naturally, I rushed into the shop immediately, as we have
gotten to know each other quite well by now. We always have lively
conversations about the situation in the neighborhoods of North
Beach, Mission (where the hairdresser is from), and the stock market.
Once, while cutting my hair, the hairdresser even placed an order
with his stockbroker over the phone! So, it happened in the airport
hair salon that I overheard a gentleman from Germany sitting in the
barber's chair, and of course, it was amusing. The three of us had an
animated conversation in English about everything under the sun. Then
another gentleman came through the door and asked something. Although
he tried hard to speak American, it took less than a split second to
identify him as German too--and on a whim, I made jokes and asked if
he also, etc. ... and what did the man say? "Yes." And he disappeared
through the door outside. For years, I have kept silent! Enough is
enough! I can't take it anymore! I have to speak: Dear fellow
Germans! Don't always be so grumpy! You are--like the weather back
home. Rain, rain, rain. Do you never have fun? Never in a good mood?
Just feel like spreading your humor for no particular reason? Being a
"dancing star" in the sense of Nietzsche? Oh, it will be difficult to
return to Germany...

@Z: First names and their abbreviations

<pic images/aol.ps My business card at AOL>

<em>Michael</em> 
Perhaps you've already noticed that the American President is named
"Bill" Clinton. "Bill" is the abbreviation for "William." So, in his
passport, the man is listed as "William Clinton," but the whole world
calls him "Bill." The same goes for Bill Gates. The founder of
Netscape, Jim Clark, is actually named "James." Or take the CEO of
AOL, Steve Case--his real name is "Stephen." Or the
second-in-command, Bob Pittman, whose real name is "Robert." My
colleague is called "Chris," but on his driver's license, it says
"Christopher." That's how it is in America. Every name is shortened:
Catherine becomes "Cathy," Donald becomes "Don," Joseph becomes
"Joe," Samantha becomes "Sam," Pamela becomes "Pam," and Lawrence
becomes "Larry." Unlike in Germany, where you might be called by a
nickname in a casual setting, it goes much further here: there's a
distinction between the name and the "legal" name. The "legal" name
is the birth name, which only appears on official documents. Everyone
else knows only the abbreviation. From "Michael" (pronounced "My-kel"
in English), you can become "Mike," "Mick," "Mikey," or
"Mickey"--whatever you prefer. So, for fun, I called myself "Mike" at
Netscape--and that's how people address me now. The sign on my
cubicle reads "Mike Schilli," just like the entry in the phone book.
Even my business card (see illustration) only knows "Mike," not
"Michael." Only pretentious people (like Robert Redford, not "Bob
Redford") or the English (like David Bowie, not "Dave Bowie") use
their full first names.

Here are a few facts about naming conventions here in America: Anyone
can give their children any first name they choose. This is different
from Germany, where there is a book from which you have to pick a
name. I vaguely remember a case in Germany where parents were not
allowed to name their child "Pumuckl"--perhaps to the child's
advantage, but that's beside the point here. Unthinkable in America.
Here, there are unfortunately no such restrictions. This results in a
variety of names that are unusual by German standards--it is not
uncommon for someone to introduce themselves with a first name that
you can't quite imagine: I know people named "Rexxon." "Zack" is also
quite popular. Or "Guy." I know someone named "Ransom." Some people
have first names that are the last names of famous writers (e.g.,
Bronte in the movie "Greencard"). There are children who are simply
named "Q." There are famous basketball players with the first name
"Jesus." In Angelika's kindergarten, there is a child named "Rain.

If someone is not satisfied with their own name, they can change it
at any time without needing a significant justification. In the
1960s, there was once a show jumper in Germany named "OberblÃ¶del,"
who was allowed to change his name to "OberrÃ¶ter" -- a major action
and a rare exception. For American citizens, this process is less
complicated: I know of a case where a follower of Bhagwan changed his
entire name to "Kantra" -- even his credit cards no longer showed his
first and last name, but only "Kantra.

Anyone who has a name that is difficult to pronounce in American
often adopts an American one--many Asians do this, and they
officially go by "Bill" or "Paul," even though their birth name was,
for example, "Yunjji." I am now called "Mike." Let's see how long I
like it.

@Z: Speaking American with the Pros

<em>Michael</em> 
And starting with this newsletter, we are launching a new series:
Learn to Speak American with the Pros! With each newsletter, we will
introduce three words or phrases that are typically American and are
guaranteed not to be taught in any school in the world. Exclusively
in the newsletter. Let's get started: When something extraordinarily
bizarre happens, you say "That's a doozy!" (pronounced: "Duhsie").
The word is said to originate from "Duesenberg," a luxury car from
the 1920s and 1930s. A word that I personally find super funny is
"Geezer" (pronounced: "Gieser"). It means something like "odd old
codger." When I'm sitting at a table with people who are all 30 or
younger, I say, "Looks like I'm the geezer here!" And number three:
"I got ripped off! I got screwed!" means: I got swindled. That's it
for today from the American everyday lexicon. I probably don't need
to say that you should use these terms very carefully, as this is
very colloquial English that you shouldn't use in job interviews, for
example. Have fun with it! Now it's time for Angelika, who has once
broken down how it works with the visa and the Green Card in America!

@Z: Visa for the USA

<em>Angelika</em> 
Should I actually still get a chance? Well then, let's quickly get
typing before Michael comes up with something else. Now that there is
suddenly a discussion in Germany about an immigration law modeled
after the American system, here is the continuation on "immigration,"
as the American likes to say. But before I delve into how one can
obtain a permanent work and residence permit, the so-called Green
Card, in the USA, I would like to list for fun, since we are often
asked about the different types of visas in the USA, and explain a
little about what they entail. Now, this may seem completely boring
to some, as it is pure bureaucracy, but on the other hand, just from
such a list, things become apparent that one would otherwise not
think about. And I don't mean the obvious fact that the whole thing
is incredibly complicated, but rather that, firstly, pure selfishness
is also behind the American immigration laws, namely to bring in
workers that are urgently needed so that the economy doesn't
stagnate, or to recruit smart minds of all kinds to advance America.
Secondly, the American's unwavering belief in family becomes visible,
as it is taken for granted that almost every visa category allows you
to bring minor children and your spouse, even though in most cases
the accompanying family members do not receive a work permit. The
tendency for family reunification is also evident with the Green
Card.

[#h1b]

There are the following visa categories in the non-immigrant
category:

The table below shows the visa categories in the non-immigrant
category.



A-1, A-2, A-3 visas are valid for diplomats and other officials or
employees of foreign governments, as well as for their immediate
family members and household staff.


B-1 visa for business travelers (Temporary Visitor for Business) who
enter the USA for a limited period and leave the USA after completing
their business. The business traveler may not be employed in the USA
or become employed there, must be fully paid by the foreign employer
for their services, and must have a residence outside the USA.


B-2 Visa (Temporary Visitor for Pleasure) for tourists who want to
travel to the USA or visit friends and relatives. The visa generally
allows for a stay of up to six months. As a tourist, you are
prohibited from working or studying in the USA. You must have
sufficient funds to support yourself during your stay. And here's a
little side note: In the past, all German tourists needed this visa.
When Michael and I went on vacation to the USA for the first time, we
had this visa in our passports. In the meantime, the visa requirement
for Germany and many other countries, especially European ones, has
been lifted, and the so-called "Visa Waiver Pilot Program" (for
tourists and business travelers) has been introduced. This means that
if you can present a return ticket upon entry and do not wish to stay
longer than 90 days, you no longer need a visa to enter as a German
citizen. The only disadvantage: If you enter under the Visa Waiver
Pilot Program, you cannot change your visa status. If you suddenly
decide during your trip that you want to study in the USA, it is not
possible to apply for a student visa while in the country. Also, the
90-day limit cannot be exceeded or extended under any circumstances.


C-1 visa for transit travelers (alien in transit), i.e., individuals
who travel through the USA without interruption to reach their
destination country.


D-1 visa for crew members (sea or air). It refers to the guys and
gals who serve you food on the plane, as well as the pilot and
co-pilot.


E-1 Visa for Treaty Traders, including spouses and children. This
visa is for individuals entering the USA to engage in trade. There
must be a trade treaty between the USA and the respective country,
and the entering person must hold citizenship of the partner country.
The trade between the USA and the respective country must be of
substantial nature. Accompanying family members are not allowed to
take up employment in the USA.


E-2 Visa for Investors, including Spouses and Children (Treaty
Investor): The investor must be a national of a treaty country with
the USA and make substantial investments in the USA, such as
establishing and managing a company locally. What is considered
"substantial" is determined by the immigration authorities. Simply
depositing a large sum of money in an American bank account is not
sufficient. The visa is typically issued initially for five years and
can be renewed, provided the business is successful. Accompanying
family members are not allowed to work in the USA.


F-1 Student Visa (Academic or Language Students). Anyone who wants to
study at an American college, university, language school, etc.,
needs this visa. The educational institution must be recognized by
the immigration authorities. The student must not give up their
residence in their home country, must be a full-time student, have
sufficient English language skills, and have enough funds available
to finance their studies and living expenses. The visa is valid until
the completion of studies. In exceptional cases, one may take up
part-time employment.


F-2 visa for spouses and minor children (under 21 years of age) of
students in the F-1 category. A work permit is not granted in this
category.


G-Visa for employees of international organizations (Representatives
to International Organizations). There are five different categories.
This refers to organizations such as the Red Cross or the UN.


H-1A visa for nurses (Registered Nurse): This visa category was
introduced exclusively for nurses in 1989 and was discontinued in
September 1995.


H-1B visa for temporary workers in specialty occupations. This is the
visa that Michael has, and you already know all about it. Just as a
reminder: It is granted for a maximum of six years, requires having a
profession that is in short supply in America, and possessing a
higher academic degree (equivalent to an American bachelor's degree)
or the corresponding work experience. With this visa, you are only
allowed to work for the employer who applied for the visa.


H-2A visa for temporary agricultural workers. This refers to, for
example, pickers who are brought into the country during harvest time
because there are not enough American workers available. However, the
reality is that in the artichoke and strawberry fields of California,
you often find illegally immigrated Mexicans who are harvesting the
fields.


H-2B visa for temporary skilled and unskilled workers. To obtain this
visa, it must also be demonstrated that there are no American workers
available for the respective job.


H-3 visa for interns and trainees (Temporary Trainees). This visa
allows foreigners to temporarily undergo practical training that is
not available in their home country.


H-4 visa for spouses and children of foreigners who have an H-1B,
H-2A/B, or H-3. This includes myself. In this category, it is not
permitted to take up employment.


I-Visa for foreign media representatives, including their spouses and
children (Representatives of International Media). If you are a
representative of the press, radio, or television, you can obtain
this visa to conduct journalistic work in the USA.


J-1 visa for participants in exchange programs (Exchange Visitor).
This visa is granted to foreign pupils, students, interns, teachers,
researchers, professors, etc., who participate in an exchange
program. Au pairs also fall under this category. The exchange program
must be recognized by the USIA (United States Information Agency).
The permitted duration of stay depends on the exchange program.


J-2 visa for spouses and children of J-1 visa holders. Spouses can
work with permission from the immigration authorities if the income
is needed to support living expenses.


K-1 Visa for FiancÃ©es or FiancÃ©s of U.S. Citizens. FiancÃ©es or
fiancÃ©s of Americans are allowed to enter the USA if they get
married within 90 days. A medical certificate and police clearance
certificates, among other documents, must be provided. The fiancÃ©es
or fiancÃ©s must have met in person within the last two years. This
visa is subject to particularly strict scrutiny to ensure all
conditions are met, as marriage can lead to obtaining a Green Card.


The K-2 visa is intended for the minor children of the fiancÃ©(e), as
they also want to be present at the wedding.


L-1 Visa for Intra-Company Transferees (Multinational Companies):
This visa category was introduced to allow multinational companies to
transfer their employees to their American branches as needed. Before
submitting the application to the immigration authorities, the person
must have worked for the company for at least one year within the
last three years. The applicant must work in the U.S. for the company
as a manager or executive, or possess specialized knowledge.
Typically, the L visa is initially granted for three years and can be
extended in two-year increments. For managers and executives, it is
valid for a maximum of seven years, while for employees with
specialized knowledge, the stay is limited to five years. Once the
maximum is reached, the person must live outside the U.S. for at
least one year before a new application in the L category can be
submitted (the same rule also applies to the H-1B visa).
Interestingly, the time spent in the U.S. under the L category or
H-1B category is accumulated and counts together towards the maximum.
This is cleverly designed, as many companies are now multinational,
allowing for the possibility of applying for both an H-1B and an L-1
in many cases.


L-2 visa for the spouses and children of the L-1 visa holder.


M-1 Visa for Vocational and Nonacademic Students: This visa, unlike
the F-1 visa (academic student visa), is intended for foreigners who
wish to attend a vocational school or a nonacademic institution
(excluding language schools) in the USA full-time. The school must
also be recognized by the immigration authorities. The individual
must not give up their foreign residence and must have sufficient
English skills, as well as be able to finance their education and
stay independently. The maximum duration of stay is one year or as
long as the training lasts. After completing the training, one may be
employed for up to six months, as long as it is practical training
related to the education.


M-2 visa for spouses and minor children of an M-1 visa holder.


NATO visa for NATO employees: Yes, NATO employees actually receive
their own visa, and there are, believe it or not, a total of 7 (in
words, seven) subcategories.


O-1 visa for individuals with extraordinary abilities in the fields
of arts, sciences, education, business, film and television, and
athletics (Aliens of Extraordinary Ability in the Arts, Sciences,
Education, Business or Athletics). This visa allows Nobel Prize
winners or even Thomas Gottschalk and the like to live and work
temporarily in the USA.


O-2 visa for assistants of artists, entertainers, athletes,
scientists who are needed to carry out an artistic, athletic, etc.
event.


O-3 visa for spouses and children of O-1/O-2 visa holders.


The P-1 visa (Internationally Recognized Athletes and Artists) is for
individual athletes or sports teams, as well as entertainers when
they perform as groups. The athletes and entertainers must be
internationally recognized.


The P-2 visa (Artists and Entertainers in Reciprocal Exchange
Programs) can be applied for by artists and entertainers
participating in a reciprocal exchange program.


The P-3 visa (Artists and Entertainers Coming to the U.S. to Give
Culturally Unique Performances) is intended for artists and
entertainers who wish to participate in a culturally unique program.


P-4 visa for spouses and children of P-1/P-2/P-3 visa holders.


Q-1 Visa for Participants in Cultural Exchange Programs: The visa can
be obtained for a maximum of 15 months if, as part of the program,
one represents the culture, history, and traditions of their own home
country.


Q-2 visa for immediate family members of the Q-1 visa holder.

Now one must know that the immigration authority generally does not
issue visas to the following groups of people:

The translation to English is: "Foreigners who have dangerous
contagious diseases such as AIDS.

Persons with physical or mental disorders, as well as behavioral
disorders, who pose a danger to themselves or others.

The German word "DrogenabhÃ¤ngige" translates to "drug addict" in
English.

Foreigners who have been convicted or arrested for certain crimes
(this includes crimes of "moral turpitude," sounds good, doesn't it?
:)

The German word "Prostituierte" translates to "prostitute" in
English.

Terrorists or individuals who could threaten the public safety of the
USA

Translation: "Persons who are or have been members of a communist or
other totalitarian party within the last two years prior to applying
for a visa.

Persons who were involved in National Socialist crimes from 1933 to
1945 or were part of the National Socialist government in Germany or
the territories occupied by Germany.

Foreigners who have been deported from the USA before.

Those of you who have been to the USA before might remember that on
the plane, you always have to fill out a green form from the
immigration authorities (if you are not subject to visa
requirements), which checks exactly these categories. Questions such
as "Have you ever been arrested or convicted for an offense or
crime?" "Are you or have you ever been a member of a terrorist
organization?" "Have you ever worked as a prostitute or pimp?" etc.,
appear on it. Of course, the whole thing seems somewhat ridiculous,
because which terrorist would willingly answer "yes" to these
questions? The comforting note on the form that answering "yes" does
not automatically result in being denied entry also seems rather
absurd. Another peculiar aspect of entering the United States, which
often confuses foreigners, is that an American visa in your passport
does not automatically entitle you to enter the USA. The immigration
officer at the border (in practice, this is usually the airport where
you first set foot on American soil) checks again whether you are
eligible to enter the "promised land." Anyone who appears suspicious
in any way or, for example, intends to work when the visa does not
allow it, will be sent back. I remember that during my very first
entry into the USA (at the tender age of 21 as a student), I had to
lay out my traveler's checks in front of the officer to prove that I
had enough funds to finance my vacation and was not dependent on
work. In general, the immigration officer has the right to deny entry
to anyone who seems suspicious and to put them on the next plane back
home without a word. The immigration officer also determines the
length of stay, which can certainly differ from the maximum allowed
by the visa.

Here's the translation to English:

"This on the topic of American visas. Just one last thing: Our visa
was actually extended until October 2002. That really borders on a
miracle, hooray!

Now, I had promised you some information about the American Green
Card. Here follows an exclusive (haha) article that I wrote myself
when the Green Card discussion started in Germany. I boldly sent it
to the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, hoping they would be interested.
Unfortunately, that was not the case; it seemed to me that they
didn't even read it. But now I have a rejection letter from the
SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, which I can frame on occasion. So now you will
be subjected to the article:

@Z: Waiting for the Green Card

<pic images/gcfinal.ps The coveted American Green Card>

<em>Angelika</em> 
The American Green Card has been a topic of discussion since
Chancellor Gerhard SchrÃ¶der announced plans to bring foreign
computer experts into the country. However, even in the land of
unlimited opportunities, there are many hurdles to overcome before
one can hold the coveted document in their hands.

Ran to the mailbox full of excitement again. Will the long-awaited
letter be there this time? Just a few seconds later, disappointment
sets in. Unfortunately, nothing won. But maybe tomorrow. There is
still hope.

We are not waiting for the grand prize in a sweepstakes, but rather
for mail from the American immigration authorities. This is because
we have hoped for our luck for the third time and participated in the
Green Card lottery. Yes, the Americans allow you to win your
permanent work and residence permit, the so-called Green Card, in a
lottery. Every year, 55,000 of these no longer green cards are
raffled off among applicants from countries that send only a few
immigrants to the USA. Germany also falls into this category.
However, no single country receives more than 7% of the total amount
through the lottery. The chances are still not bad, especially if you
are married, as both spouses are allowed to participate
independently. If one wins the Green Card, the other automatically
gets it too. They are quite family-friendly in this regard.
Participating is also not difficult and only costs a postage stamp to
send the ticket by mail. You can play from both Germany and the USA.
You hardly need to send more than your name, date of birth, the
country you were born in, and a valid address. A passport photo must
also be included. Of course, there are some small traps built in, as
they don't want to make it too easy for applicants. For example, the
application can only be sent via regular mail within a precisely
defined period. The envelope must not exceed a certain size, and the
passport photo has exact dimensions. Only those letters that meet the
form requirements are accepted, and then a computer draws the lucky
winners. But even if you win, you cannot breathe a sigh of relief
yet. "Winning" only means that the American immigration authorities
will check whether you are even worthy of receiving a Green Card.
This includes having completed an education equivalent to the
American high school diploma--twelve years of schooling in Germany or
two years of work experience within the last five years in a
profession that requires at least two years of training. You must not
be HIV-infected or suffer from contagious diseases and must present a
spotless police clearance certificate. "Give me your tired, poor,
your huddled masses?"--that was once upon a time. The authorities
also meanly draw more than 55,000 potential winners, as some are
known to suddenly withdraw or do not meet the conditions. However,
this is, of course, difficult to estimate. And so there are unlucky
people who won, met all the requirements, and still came up
empty-handed because the magic number of 55,000 was reached.

Now, the lottery is not the only way to obtain an American Green
Card. On one hand, an American citizen related to the applicant can
apply for a Green Card with the American immigration authorities. If
you don't have an American relative available and also no luck with
the lottery, an American employer for whom you are already working in
America can also file a petition. However, the immigration
authorities first conduct an extremely cumbersome process to verify
that no American can perform the job. This only leads to success in
professions for which America is desperately seeking people. And here
the circle closes, as there is a strong demand for computer experts,
especially in the high-tech Silicon Valley adjacent to San Francisco.

If you follow the discussion about the SchrÃ¶der proposal, you get
the impression that in America, a Green Card is practically handed to
you. Far from it. Obtaining a Green Card with the help of an American
employer is a lengthy, nerve-wracking, and extremely bureaucratic
process. If you are unlucky enough to have to apply in California,
one of the states with the highest immigration numbers in the USA,
you can currently expect waiting times of up to six years. Most
foreign computer experts in the USA work on what is known as an H-1B
visa, which grants highly skilled workers a work and residence permit
for a maximum of six years. This puts you at a disadvantage: the visa
expires before the immigration authorities have finished processing
the Green Card application--even if the application is submitted as
soon as you set foot on American soil. Additionally, companies are
not always willing to immediately apply for a Green Card, as they
first want to ensure that the foreign employee provides good service.
Moreover, the H-1B visa has a significant advantage for the employer:
the work permit is valid only for a specific company--a job change
sets the massive bureaucratic machinery in motion again.

The Green Card, on the other hand, grants free choice of employment.
Companies thus lose the visa dependency of the employee, but due to
the extreme shortage of computer specialists, most companies no
longer shy away from this step. No matter what, they want qualified
employees. Even the ongoing American presidential election campaign
has picked up on this issue. A shortening of the Green Card process
for computer experts is not yet under discussion, but the various
candidates are boasting that the annual cap on H-1B visas could be
increased. Currently, this is 115,000 per year. Once they are
allocated, an applicant has no choice but to wait. This can sometimes
mean months.

Back to the Green Card. If the American employer files the petition
for the Green Card, there are three steps to go through. Above all,
the application for the so-called "Certification of Labor" prolongs
the process. In this first step, the American company must prove
through a highly complicated procedure that it was unable to find an
American citizen for the advertised job, and this must be documented
with job advertisements in newspapers and conducted interviews.

This process alone can take up to two years in California. Only after
receiving the highly coveted certificate can the petition be
submitted to the immigration authorities. Again, it takes up to a
year for the application to be processed. The third step is called
"Adjustment of Status" and refers to the transition from
non-immigrant to immigrant. Current waiting time in California: two
to three years! That makes five to six years for all three steps.
Adding to the difficulty is the fact that during this time period,
one cannot change employers nor be laid off. If this happens, even
just before reaching the goal, it means: back to square one!
Ruthless.

With a lottery win, it would naturally go a bit faster. If won this
year, the Green Card could already be in the mailbox by the end of
2001. With a bit of luck -- or, if not: It's heard that computer
specialists are being sought again in Germany...
