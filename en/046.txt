@Z: California Chaos - The Recall

<pic images/a3.ps The Arnold Case - An Austrian is Governor of California>

<em>Angelika</em> 
Why does every random actor in America believe that the Hollywood
experience qualifies them to hold political office? This question
has been bothering me since muscle man and film star Arnold
Schwarzenegger entered the race for the position of Governor of
California.

Yesterday, on October 7th, the decision was made that California
voters bid farewell to the incumbent Governor Gray Davis in the
recall election and instead allowed "Arnie" to take the reins. It is
hard to believe: The world's fifth-largest economy and the most
populous state in the USA is now being led by a politically
inexperienced Hollywood star with an Austrian accent.

Has the abundant sunshine gone to Californians' heads? Much of it
has to do with how election campaigns are conducted in America. There
is hardly any detailed information about political programs of
individual candidates. Instead, short campaign ads from the
leading contestants are constantly being aired on television.
However, these ads offer little more than platitudes. Arnold's
statement was simple: "Politicians have let us down."

Cruz Bustamante, the only Democratic candidate and a Latino, who is
therefore more popular among the Spanish-speaking population, sat in
front of the camera with a tense smile, accompanied by his family. He also
had a hard time getting his campaign slogan across, as he wanted
voters to vote against the recall of Gray Davis and, in the second
step, for him, to ensure that California would not fall into the
hands of a Republican governor. I mentioned the peculiar
election procedure in the last newsletter (<RBLINK>0030801#3</RBLINK>).
Eligible Voters could pick a candidate, even if they had
expressed opposition to Davis's resignation in the first step of the
election process.

In the television nation of America, by the way, there are hardly any
election posters, like the ones known in Germany. Not a single one could
be seen in all of San Francisco. However, there was the obligatory
televised debate with the main candidates, where political concepts
were actually being discussed. In California, everyone was eagerly awaiting
this debate because voters especially wanted to see how Arnold would
perform without delivering rehearsed lines. Unfortunately, the debate
format was disappointing. The discussion topics were announced in
advance, which is unusual, allowing the candidates to prepare, and
participants were allowed to interrupt each other. Many were annoyed
that the organizers had not invited incumbent Governor Gray Davis.
Only candidates who had approval ratings of at least 10 percent in the polls (a
total of five) were on the guest list, and Gray Davis was excluded.

In such debates, it is not only important what an individual is saying,
but also how they present themselves. You have to give Schwarzenegger
credit for that: he has learned how to market himself and he also has
the necessary funds to do so. Naturally, it worked to his advantage
that, among 135 candidates, he was a familiar face, event to those
who are not particularly politically savvy, and the press
pounced on him like vultures.

In American election campaigns, it is generally true that those who
do not present themselves effectively in the media have no chance of
winning. Arnold understands this better than anyone. Initially, he kept a
low profile and did not reveal whether he would even run, only to
then announce his intention to become the next governor of California
with great fanfare on Jay Leno's talk show (a format similar to Harald
Schmidt's show in Germany).

<pic images/a5.ps Arnold announces on Jay Leno that he is running.>

To improve his poor image regarding the treatment of women--after
all, he is considered a womanizer and a "breast groper"--he and his
wife Maria Shriver moved in with the black talk show host Oprah
Winfrey and presented himself as a caring father of four children as
well as a loving and attentive husband. This appearance certainly
earned him many female votes, as the "Oprah" show not only achieves
fantastic ratings but is also regarded by many women as the holy scripture.

<pic images/a2.ps Arnold with Maria at Oprah's>

This PR stunt was marred by the fact that just a few days before
the election, the Los Angeles Times published the stories of six
women who confirmed that Schwarzenegger had groped them, after which
Arnie apologized contritely for his past boorish behavior on camera.

The New York Times took it a step further and quoted some foolish remarks by
Schwarzenegger: In the seventies, he had expressed admiration for Hitler's
rise and his oratory skills on several occasions. Being portrayed as a
harasser of women and as a Nazi -- that doesn't go over well in America.
However, voters here also know that airing dirty laundry is part of every
American election campaign.

Additionally, Americans love all kinds of conspiracy theories. So, right after
the article was published in the Los Angeles Times, it was suspected that only
a political opponent could be behind this story, trying to bring the
"Terminator" to his knees just before October 7th, because he was leading in
the polls. But let's forget these soap opera dramas for a moment and focus on
the political aspect: Arnold Schwarzenegger belongs to the moderate wing of
the Republican Party (Please do not confuse with the German Republican
Party). He supports existing abortion rights, known in America as "Pro
Choice," to distinguish himself from the anti-abortion movement "Pro Life."

<pic images/a1.ps Arnold's Happy Clone Family>

He is in favor of gun control and advocates for the rights of
homosexuals. These are all issues supported by the vast majority of
California's population. With this more liberal mindset, he
certainly appeals to Democratic voters. On the other hand, he
argues that Californians are being overtaxed and vows not to fill the
California budget deficit by raising taxes, which seems almost
impossible considering the size of the gap.

Environmentalists and pacifists hate that he drives a so-called
"Hummer," a military jeep modified for regular road use (just like
the former soccer player Stefan Effenberg).

Immigrants, of whom there are quite a few in California with American
citizenship and thus the right to vote, like that Schwarzenegger embodies the
American Dream like no other: A nobody from Austria not only made a name for
himself as a bodybuilder but also became a famous movie star, despite his
terrible accent, raking in millions in the process.  And to top it all off, he
is married into the Kennedy clan, probably the most well-known family in
America.

Unfortunately, our previous governor Gray Davis made the faux pas of joking
about Arnold's accent by remarking that no one should become governor who
cannot pronounce the word "California" correctly. He seemed to have
temporarily forgotten that he is leading a state with a high percentage of
residents who do not speak English as their first language. But Schwarzenegger
also ruffled some feathers, especially with Mexican immigrants. He criticized
a new California law that Gray Davis had just signed, which allows illegal
immigrants to obtain a California driver's license.

The entire "recall" process that led to this special election can be
characterized as something typically Californian, although this political
mechanism is also permitted in other states. California likes to present
itself as radically democratic, following the motto: The people decide. And
what could be more democratic than voting out a politician who is not doing
his job properly?

The whole thing is somewhat short-sighted. If a politician is always acting
out of fear that a recall process is looming, all progress eventually comes to
a halt. Already, there are threats circulating that the next "recall" is in
turn targeting Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Political events in California are also hindered by a provision
in the Californian constitution that you in Germany have probably never
heard of. Voters can directly pass or repeal laws through a popular
initiative (called an "initiative") or a referendum (called a
"referendum"). As a result, there are constantly various initiatives
here that are poorly thought out and hardly financially viable --
moreover, they often contradict each other.

One of the most famous referendums, the so-called Proposition 13, was
passed by voters in 1978 with the aim of keeping the "Property Tax"
(comparable to the property tax in Germany) low: Since then, the
"Property Tax Rate" has been limited to 1 percent of the assessed
property value with very limited yearly increases except if the
property's ownership
changes. You might say: a dream for every homeowner. However,
it must be noted that the rapid deterioration of California's public
schools is attributed to Proposition 13, as local schools are largely
funded by the property tax. And so the circle closes: Because
California's budget has become more dependent on the revenues from
California's income tax due to Proposition 13, the general
deterioration of the American economic situation and the bursting of
the dot-com bubble hit California particularly hard. Company
closures, layoffs, and the lack of tax revenue from sold employee
stock options caused the budget deficit to grow significantly, which
was one of the main arguments for the recall.

But back to Arnold: I'm just glad that the man can't become
President, because the American Constitution states that one must be
born in America to qualify. However, for some time now, there have
been efforts by some politicians to amend the Constitution in this
regard. The following proposal by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch from
Utah, allegedly a friend of Schwarzenegger's, is currently
circulating: An American citizen who has held American citizenship
for 20 years should be allowed to run for the presidency. And guess
when Arnold Schwarzenegger exchanged his Austrian passport for an
American one. 20 years ago! What a coincidence!

@Z: Oahu

<em>Michael</em> 
To escape the stupid TV chatter of the Austrian village idiot, we
retreated to Hawaii for two weeks in September. On the flight there,
we noticed that due to new FAA security regulations, the curtain
between first and second class had to be removed - we laughed so
much! So, those who pay three times the airfare or tie themselves to
an airline with frequent flyer miles to snag an "upgrade" no longer
even have the right to protection from the common folk in economy
class, who then cheekily and unauthorizedly run to the first-class
toilet - outrageous! Rumor has it that even Bill Gates doesn't fly
first class because he doesn't see the point in shelling out
exorbitant sums for the minor comfort difference. Probably one of the
few areas where Bill Gates and I agree.

<pic images/mow.ps Urban Oahu>

But back to Hawaii: This time we decided to explore urban Hawaii.
After all, we're not getting any younger and need to scout out
potential retirement homes. As seasoned travelers, we no longer stay
in hotels in Hawaii; instead, we always rent small houses from
private individuals.

<pic images/sears.ps Rice fields and Sears.>

We also explored the less attractive sides of Hawaii: The main island
of Oahu, with the capital Honolulu, already shows some significant
architectural sins. Honolulu always reminds me of San Jose, a typical
American city, built up in the 50s and 60s without any historical
context. As a result, an entire city can quickly end up looking like
Landsbergerstraße in Munich.

<pic images/m3.ps Corner Store>

<pic images/oahu1.ps Water pipes>

However, if you head out to the east or up to the north coast, the
concrete jungle disappears, and you're back in surfer's paradise. You
hang out on beaches where mainly locals and surfers from all over the
world who have retired from working life hang out. It's quite
fascinating: on one hand, having a hut on the beach, and on the
other, having a huge supermarket like "Costco" within reach, where
you can buy a pack of 20 shrimp for 8 dollars, which you can quickly
throw on the gas grill, naturally set up in front of the hut, and
devour in no time. Oh yeah.

@Z: Record of the Month

<pic images/astoria.ps "So Long, Astoria" by The Ataris

<em>Michael</em> 
To recommend this album, I waited a few months at first, because
sometimes I end up liking something that later becomes embarrassingly
cringeworthy. But after thorough consideration, I'm letting it out:
"So Long, Astoria" by "The Ataris." A bunch of 18-year-old guys
playing exactly how you'd expect 18-year-old guys to play, a kind of
slightly serious fun-punk. Of course, I can't go to the concert; I'd
be kicked out immediately as the old guy. I may quote: "Being grown
up isn't half as fun as growing up." Ah, youth! (No, I'm not having a
midlife crisis).

@Z: An Ode to the Internet

<em>Michael</em> 
When I was a little boy, it was incredibly difficult, if not
impossible, to get answers to simple questions. I had a 24-volume
encyclopedia from some book club that explained the most important
words and contained interesting discussions on historical events, but
my questions were different: "What is the name of the song currently
playing on the radio?" "Why is the sky blue?" "Why does the stack on
the HP-41CV have no more than four registers?" No one knew the
answers to these questions.

With the internet, now suddenly everything is available. Because there's
always someone somewhere who knows exactly what you're looking for.
However, the internet is typically American: a bunch of chaos and
half of it isn't true. But Google outsmarts this by using clever
algorithms to prioritize information that more people find useful.

This is how the internet solves problems today that were difficult to solve in
the past: A provider that cheats its customers will be exposed and done for
within days. Well-informed consumers quickly put an end to shady providers. Or
take eBay, for example: This system of mutual self-regulation actually makes it
possible to conduct business by mail with people you've never seen in your life
and probably never will meet.

Or when I recently watched the excellent film "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon," and I wondered if I had already seen the actress
Zhang Ziyi, who is starring in it, in the Jackie Chan kung fu movie "Rush
Hour 2." In the past, no one could have researched such questions.
Today, it takes 20 seconds. The answer is: Yes!

And often it happens that I don't understand the lyrics of a song.
What an effort that used to be! I can still clearly remember the
hours spent rewinding and fast-forwarding to catch even the last
scrap of content. Nowadays, that's no longer a problem: You simply
enter the snippets of sentences you understand into the search field
of "google.com," and the search engine immediately provides dozens of
references to websites where diligent helpers have accurately typed
out those exact lyrics. Recently, I was puzzled by the word
"Shucklak" in the song "Mic Check" by "Rage Against The Machine." No
problem: On <LINK>http://www.musicfanclubs.org/rage/lyrics/miccheck.htm|the Internet|'Mic Check' Lyrics</LINK> I found the
exact lyrics to the song and also an explanation of the unusual word:
That is the sound a gun makes when being cocked.

And just as we contribute to this revolution with our newsletters and
proclaim the unvarnished truth about America, hundreds of thousands
of others do the same in their fields of expertise. Who would want to
live in another time!

@Z: Queer Eye for the Straight Guy

<em>Michael</em> 
The bad taste of Americans is indeed legendary. Whether you look at
home furnishings or how people dress: apart from a few
mega-metropolises (New York, San Francisco, etc.), the entire country
is a fashion wasteland. Karl Lagerfeld would roll his eyes, wave his
fan vigorously, and then faint if he ever wandered through a typical
small town in the Midwest.

<pic images/qesg4.ps These sloppy gentlemen are in urgent need of a
makeover.>

Many people are happy to acknowledge this and seek professional
advice on taste--preferably for free in so-called "makeover" TV
shows. There are now about a dozen of these, and the pattern goes
like this: Friends report fashion-challenged individuals or owners of
sloppily furnished apartments to the TV show. The show then sends a
team of interior designers, craftsmen, hairdressers, beauticians,
fashion experts, dance instructors, or cooking specialists to the
location to transform everything and then broadcast it in detail with
a before-and-after effect on television.

In "While You Were Out," the victim is lured out of their home for a
while under some pretext, only to return and find it wonderfully
renovated. In "Trading Spaces" (a show that, amusingly, originally
came from Great Britain, where a similar lack of taste prevails), two
neighbors swap homes for 48 hours and, with the help of designers and
a lot of personal effort, transform the rooms to a high gloss. From
my personal statistics, I can tell you that 95% of all successfully
treated individuals exclaim "Oh my Gosh!" when they see the changes.
In almost all cases, they jump for joy, and only very rarely are
there long faces because the designer went a bit overboard.

<pic images/qesg5.ps The translation of "Eine unappetitliche
JungesellenhÃ¼tte" to English is "An unappetizing bachelor pad.>

<pic images/qesg6.ps ... transforms into a gigolo apartment>

Currently, a new show is breaking all records: "Queer Eye for the
Straight Guy." Instead of translating it literally, I'll tell you
what it's about: A quintet of trendy, young, gay city men, known as
the "Fab 5," act as a mobile task force for all sorts of problem
cases. Most often, these are bachelors living in completely rundown
apartments with crusty bathtubs, eating pizza and drinking canned
beer, wearing jeans and flannel shirts, and holding lifelong
non-dancer passes.

Since gay men often engage more with matters of taste, fashion,
style, art, and personal grooming than their heterosexual
counterparts, this is usually a great success. The quintet then
extensively shows the "slob" how to behave at the table, for example,
how to eat a lobster, take the beloved to the disco, and then invite
them to the newly renovated apartment. There are no taboos: hairy
fellows might be taken to the beauty salon to have their back hair
waxed or use the brand-new Norelco nose hair trimmer to tackle the
"nose hair situation.

<pic images/qesg3.ps The "Fab 5" from "Queer Eye for the Straight
Guy>

In doing so, the "Fab 5" deliberately play with gay stereotypes,
especially the fashion expert sometimes behaves in a really
flamboyant manner. But it's clear that this is not meant seriously;
rather, it mostly serves to tease out any small homophobic tendencies
in the "Straight Guy" and to embarrass him. The show is also very
well received in gay circles; all our friends are enthusiastic "Fab
5" fans. And even the conservative America outside of San Francisco
finds the show great.

After the work is done, the five of them always sit together in style
with a glass of wine and watch live on TV as their new protÃ©gÃ© gets
ready for a nice evening out and takes his girlfriend out, who, of
course, is almost beside herself with joy over the modernized
apartment when they return home. Naturally, the five also gossip
extensively and roll their eyes when someone doesn't apply the
suggested hair gel correctly, tears apart the lobster with their
hands, or quickly stuffs clothes lying around the freshly tidied
apartment under the bed instead of in the closet.

The TV images show the "Fab 5" only on Oprah Winfrey, who invited the
guys to her mega-show because of their groundbreaking success. The
show "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" is on a cable channel that I
recently canceled due to a fee increase. Surely, someone will soon
call us at home to offer it to us again at a special price -- but
until then, we have to do without.

@Z: The University Calls: School in American (Part 2)

<pic images/stan6.ps Students at Stanford University in Palo Alto>

<em>Angelika</em> 
In the last newsletter, I got up to the high school graduation. After
that, many people go on to attend an American university or college.
In Germany, I often hear the question about the difference between a
university and a college. In the USA, the term "college" is commonly
used as a general term for both. A "college" in the classical sense
lasts four years and leads to a "Bachelor's" degree (Baccalaureate =
American academic degree). At universities, various departments are
often referred to as colleges, and you typically find a medical
school and research departments. Furthermore, the university offers
study programs after obtaining a "Bachelor's Degree" to pursue a
higher academic degree, the so-called "Master's Degree" (equivalent
to a master's degree) or, for those eager to learn more, a doctorate.

According to statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Labor, 65 percent of
American students with a high school diploma attended college in
2002. This percentage might seem a bit high to you, but you must
consider that America does not have a tripartite school system. While
high school graduates in Germany enroll directly in a specific
subject at the university, the first two years at a four-year
American college typically serve as general education, including
humanities, natural and social sciences, arts, languages, and
mathematics. After completing the general education requirements, the
student focuses their studies on one or two subjects ("majors").
Depending on the chosen major, they are awarded a "Bachelor of Arts"
(B.A.) or "Bachelor of Science" (B.S.) after an additional two years.

<pic images/stan3.ps The translation of "Auf alt gemachtes GemÃ¤uer
in der Stanford-Uni" to English is "Wall made to look old at Stanford
University.>

The "Bachelor of Business Administration" (B.B.A. = Bachelor of
Economic Sciences) is also common. The four-year college can perhaps
best be described as a combination of the German Abitur and the
preliminary diploma. Many college graduates initially dive into the
workforce once they have their "Bachelor" in hand and return to
university at a later point for two to three years to earn a
"Master's Degree." In America, we also often encounter people working
in a profession that has little to do with their original "Bachelor's
Degree." Changing one's profession or career goal is not considered a
stigma in America.

In addition to the "Bachelor's Degree," there is another lower
academic degree known as the "Associate Degree," which students
receive after two years at a "Junior College" or "Community College,"
among others. These institutions offer the general education courses
of the first two years of four-year college programs and often
additionally focus on specialized vocational areas such as nursing,
business, or technology. If one wishes to transfer to a four-year
college later, this is generally not a problem, as the qualifications
obtained are recognized.

Many students choose a community college because of the more
affordable tuition fees, which are often astronomically high in
America. The City College of San Francisco, a community college that
offers countless educational programs for further education, personal
development (similar to the German Volkshochschulen), and the
acquisition of various degrees, costs, for example, $18 per unit for
California residents (a California resident is someone who has lived
in California for more than a year).

Most courses consist of three units per semester. So that amounts to
54 dollars for one course. If a student, for example, takes five such
courses, they pay 270 dollars for the respective semester. Since many
community college students work on the side, they do not enroll as
full-time students. Many use community college as a second
educational path. Perhaps you remember that I also diligently went to
City College during the first months of our stay in San Francisco to
study English.

For certain professional fields, including medicine, dentistry,
pharmacy, law, and theology, one must first obtain a "Bachelor's
Degree" in the USA before enrolling in an advanced study program to
earn a "Master's Degree" (equivalent to a Magister). Dentists spend
an additional four years in school after their "Bachelor's Degree,"
while lawyers spend at least three years. Becoming a doctor is also a
lengthy process in the USA: after the "Bachelor's," there are four
years of study, followed by a one-year clinical internship, which is
then followed by specialist training (residency) that can last from
one to eight years, depending on the specialty.
The American student life takes place on the "campus." While in
Germany university buildings of various faculties are often spread
throughout the city, in America everything is centrally located in
one place: lecture halls, research facilities, student dormitories,
library and student bookstore, sports and recreational facilities,
student organizations, and the cafeteria.

The campus of the prestigious private Stanford University in Palo
Alto--about a 45-minute drive from San Francisco--feels like its own
little town. Many students live on campus in dormitories ("dorms")
because, due to the high tuition fees, they can hardly afford
anything else.

You are probably familiar with the situation from American TV shows:
a room is often shared by two or three students. How anyone is
supposed to get any studying done in such a setting is beyond me.
Single rooms are usually only available for students in higher
semesters. It is considered normal to go into debt for one's studies.
At an elite university, that can quickly add up to $100,000.

<pic images/s71.ps The Stanford Library>

Every state and some larger American cities have their own public
universities. In California, this is the "University of California,"
with the world-famous "University of California, Berkeley" located
right in our backyard. Colleges or universities, whether public or
private, charge tuition fees in the USA. Public institutions, like
the University of California, are often more affordable--at least for
students who are considered residents of the respective state. The
funding for these institutions relies more heavily on public funds.
Currently (as of 2003), the University of California, Berkeley
charges $2,135 per semester in pure tuition fees for California
residents (one-year rule, see above), but a hefty $9,240 for
non-residents. In comparison, the private elite university Stanford
charges $9,520 per semester for programs leading to a "Bachelor's
Degree." Medical students, however, pay $11,572. As mentioned, I am
only talking about tuition fees here, meaning what the student pays
for their courses. The total does not include costs for a room,
books, health insurance, which is mandatory at many universities, or
various other fees (e.g., for enrollment). Incidentally, the
"University of California, Berkeley" has just increased its fees by a
modest 30% (already reflected in the number given above) because
public subsidies were drastically cut due to California's budget
crisis.

To finance the exorbitantly expensive education, American students
have the following options: 1) They have extremely wealthy parents
who are not hesitant to spend money with both hands. 2) The parents
have iron discipline and have been saving for college since the birth
of their son or daughter. 3) They are super smart, talented, or an
athlete and secure a scholarship. However, there are often only
partial scholarships that do not cover all costs, but at least they
do not have to be repaid. 4) They work part-time and therefore take a
bit longer to complete their studies. 5) They possess an arsenal of
credit cards with high credit limits. 6) They apply for a student
loan.

Many of our friends and acquaintances have financed their studies
through a student loan. The amount of the loan depends on the
financial situation of the parents. Student loans benefit from
government support, so no interest payments are required during the
course of study. However, the amount that must be repaid later does
include interest, although the interest rate is low. Most people make
their repayments in the form of monthly installments over a period of
many years.

Since America does not have the Abitur or another qualification that
automatically opens the doors to college, many higher education
institutions set their own admission requirements. First, the grade
point average (GPA) of the high school diploma is considered, which
is expressed numerically for these purposes rather than in the usual
letter grading system. The scale ranges from 0 to 4.0--the higher the
number, the better the average.

Most people also want to see a so-called SAT score. SAT stands for
Scholastic Aptitude Test, which is a standardized test that assesses
verbal and mathematical skills. The test lasts over three hours, and
most high school students take it. However, please do not confuse the
SAT with an exam like the Abitur. Students can score between 200 and
800 points per section (verbal and mathematical) on the SAT.
Incidentally, students can take the test as often as they like to
potentially improve their SAT score. Naturally, the free market also
offers various preparatory courses to help achieve better results on
the SAT.

For their college application, the prospective student usually has to
write an essay, submit letters of recommendation, and pay a fee.
Additionally, social engagement is always well-received. Here are
two...
