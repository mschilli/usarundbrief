@Z: Finally ready: The New Bay Bridge

<pic images/bb-span.ps The new eastern span of the Bay Bridge looks quite stunning.>

<em>Angelika</em>
Twenty-four years ago, on October 17th, 1989, to be precise,
a 6.9 earthquake rattled San Francisco, and caused severe damage
to the Bay Bridge, which connects the cities San Francisco and Oakland.
A part of the upper deck slammed down on the lower part, killing
one driver while crossing the bridge. 
Shortly after the quake, it became evident that the bridge
wouldn't withstand another blow and would need to be replaced 
urgently.
And this was the beginning of the struggle for the new bridge: 
Discussed were various building cost and design issues, 
like should it be a suspension bridge or not, one or
two decks again, or with foot and bicycle paths? What made matters
worse was that the two cities, San Francisco and Oakland, had to agree on
all issues. Both cities were run by big-headed mayors, Willie Brown in San
Francisco, and Jerry Brown, now governor of California, then mayor of 
Oakland. It took forever to build, but finally, after 24 years of 
construction drama, on September 3rd, 2013, the new bridge was 
opened to the public.

Only the eastern span is new, which connects Oakland and Yerba Buena Island
in the middle of the Bay. The western span, leading drivers
over the waters again all the way to San Francisco, remained unchanged. 
The original bridge span dates back to the 1930ies, and to make sure
it will withstand the next earthquake, it was retrofitted with new 
steel beams by the civil engineers in charge. The construction work on
the new eastern span began in January 2002, which runs alongside the
old bridge. In 2009 the drama continued: During routine checks, 
Engineers found cracks in one of the steel beams (<RBLINK>20091104#5</RBLINK>),
which lead to heated discussions about whether the steel parts for the
new span, which were manufactured in China, where a cheap product
"Made in China". Shortly before the grand opening, however, it was
discovered that the steel bolts for earthquake-proofing the bridge 
were showing cracks as well. Ironically, those weren't "Made in China", 
but "Made in USA". This lead to another round of discussions about
whether the bridge could even be reopened with the defective bolts or 
if it was prudent to wait and replace them.

The consensus was, after all, that it would be more dangerous to drive
over the old bridge during an earth quake, than over the new bridge
with its defective bolts, even though repairing them would take months.
As you can see, the project wasn't exactly inspiring confidence. 
What I found quite sad personally, was that because of this glitch, 
the grand opening celebrations, which had been planned for months
in advance, were canceled entirely. 

<pic images/bb-angelika.ps Angelika on the new Bay Bridge footpath. The new bridge is on the left, the remains of the old one on the right.>

What was still missing at this point was connecting the old western span
with the new eastern span. To accomplish this, the entire bridge was closed
over the long Labor Day weekend for a total of five days. I found it
quite miraculous that this shutdown didn't wreak total havoc on Bay
Area traffic. After all, about 240,000 cars are crossing the bridge 
on a regular day. 

Starting Wednesday, August 28th, 8 p.m., no vehicle was allowed on
the bridge anymore, in either direction. Since I had been working
in the East Bay on this legendary Wednesday, I crossed the old bridge 
around 6 p.m. for the last time. I have to admit, I got somewhat 
sentimental at the time. While I was zooming over the bridge, heavy 
construction vehicles were waiting at the curb. After five days of 
closure, in the early morning hours of Tuesday, the wait was over and police
let the first driver onto the eastern span. Later that day, I also crossed,
and the new bridge pillars were sparkling in the sun.

<pic images/bb-trail.ps The Bay Trail onto the new Bay Bridge starts across from the Ikea store in Emeryville.>

But the kicker is that now pedestriants and bicyclists have access to the
new eastern span of the Bay Bridge. There's a new foot and bike path. 
Naturally, Michael and I had to check it out last weekend. The hike
is quite strenuous, since the path stretches about 2 miles before it
even reaches the bridge. All the way to the midpoint and back, we hiked more 
than eight miles that day. The path starts right across from the Ikea
store in Emeryville, and leads through rather bleak industrial areas and
over highway bridges onto the Bay Bridge. The parking lot guard apparently
doesn't want you to park on Ikea premises if you intend to hike, but I
claim that it's a killer opportunity for Ikea, and as a matter fact, after
we were done hiking, we went into the store and bought some things, 
following the Ikea mantra: Well, we're here already, why not ... 
For what it's worth, there's another trail entrance at Maritime Street.

On the hike, we enjoyed great views on the Bay, San Francisco and the old
bridge, which is about to be disassembled over the coming years. We were
surprised to see so many people walking the trail: Parents pushing
strollers, kids on scooters, bicycle riders, runners and walkers.
At this time, the trail ends at Yerba Buena Island. That's why the locals
nick-named it "the pier". The old bridge needs to go away before the
foot and bike path can connect to Yerba Buena Island. But even then,
the trail won't go all the way to San Francisco, but there's already a 
lobby for that.

The trail exists mainly because of the accomplishments of a dedicated
individual: Alex Zuckermann of the East Bay Bike Coalition kept 
pushing for a bike-accessible Bay Bridge in political meetings for a large
part of his life. Sadly, he died in 2007 at age 86 and didn't get to 
ride the new trail on his bike. But the foot and bike path is named after
him and I bet he'd be thrilled to see how popular it is already.

@Z: German Absentee Voting

<pic images/election-angelika.ps Which party did Angelika just vote for?>

<em>Angelika</em>
We are Greencard holders, not American citizens, and therefore can't
vote in the US. But German citizens residing in a foreign country are still
eligable to vote in federal elections in Germany via absentee voting.
The regulations require having lived at least 3 months in Germany without 
interruptions after having completed one's 14th birthday, and this can't
be more than 25 years ago. Alternatively, a German citizen living 
abroad can make a case that they still have a pretty good grasp on
what's going on in German politics, but the official flyer points out
explicitely that it's not sufficient to claim to 
consume German media outlets abroad.

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/election-form.ps This official form needs to be printed out, filled in, and mailed to the electoral office of one's last residence in Germany.>
</HTMLONLY>

Well, it's been less than 25 years since we've moved here, and for that reason
we voted via absentee ballot this year. I've mentioned here before that
you can't simply get the election documents from the German consulate in
San Francisco (<RBLINK>20020917#2</RBLINK>).
According to the <LINK>http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/bundestagswahlen/BTW_BUND_13/auslandsdeutsche|Election instructions for Germans living abroad</LINK> 
we needed to send an application to be included in the election registry first.
For this to happen, the absentee voter downloads a PDF document from the 
website referenced above. It requires entering one'e name, date of birth,
passport number, and the current foreign address, as well as the
address of the last residence in Germany, including the date of when the
individual officially unregistered there.

<pic images/election-augsburg.ps A few weeks later, the election documents from the city of Augsburg/Germany arrive in San Francisco by mail.>

We're so lucky that I always keep everything on archive! On top of that,
we needed to assure that we're over 18 years of age 
and therefore eligable to vote, and
that we meet the requirements listed above for absentee voting. We then
mailed our applications to the electoral offices in the cities of our
last residence, which was Munich in my case and for Michael 
the city of Augsburg. The deadline for election applications was September
2nd this year, permitting enough time for processing. We had our doubts
that anyone over there would actually take our applications seriously, 
but apparently German public servants are still reliable as clockworks,
because after a couple of weeks, we received correctly stamped and 
addressed envelopes with the requested electoral sheets!

<pic images/election-letter.ps Stamped according to the international rate, Michael's paper ballot with his vote goes back to the city of Augsburg, Germany.>

We then used a ball pen to cast our vote, and placed the paper ballots
into the provided envelopes. The ballots go into an anonymous sealed envelope,
which then goes into the return envelope. This turned out to be 
difficult with the ballot envelope provided by the city of Augsburg, which was
excactly the size of the return envelope! The electoral office in Munich
had put more thought into it, with a slightly smaller ballot envelope 
that fit perfectly into the return envelope.

Correctly stamped ($1.10), we sent the envelopes back across the big sea.
Hopefully, they arrived there in good shape. We've read in "Spiegel"
magazine that many German citizens refrain from voting these days and it's
considered to be socially acceptible. I hope you're not one of these
people, go to the voting booth, every vote counts!

@Z: Weirdstuff Recycling

<pic images/weirdstuff-entrance.ps The "Weirdstuff" warehouse in Sunnyvale sells used computer parts.>

<em>Michael</em>
Until a few years ago, Americans didn't care much about saving the
environment or recycling, but nowadays it's extremly hip to be "green".
In previous editions of this newsletter, we've explained how to correctly
dispose of old TV sets (<RBLINK>20101219#4</RBLINK>) or to separate 
garbage into the different bins provided in San Francisco 
(<RBLINK>20060215#4</RBLINK>).

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/weirdstuff-map.ps The "Weirdstuff" warehouse is located in Sunnyvale, just around the corner from Yahoo headquarters.>
</HTMLONLY>

If you want to get rid of old computer parts in Silicon Valley, there's
a nondescript store called <LINK>http://weirdstuff.com|Weirdstuff</LINK>
at address 384 West Caribbean Drive in Sunnyvale in a warehouse neighborhood,
just around the corner from Yahoo headquarters. At the back entrance,
there's a drop-off where workers collect donated components, and the store
in front has usable parts nicely sorted on long shelves for sale 
for little money.

<pic images/weirdstuff-aisle.ps Cheap computer components for sale on the shelves.>

<pic images/weirdstuff-receipt.ps Six Dollars buy more stuff at Weirdstuff than 20 Dollars at a regular store.>

It's no secret that I like to to tinker with all kinds of components and
assemble them to create new inventions. If I bought the parts at a regular
computer store, it'd cost me an arm and a leg. Often times, used parts
are perfect for the job, and I can get them cheaply at Weirdstuff during
my lunch break. And the staff is easy-going there, I've had items with
no price tag on them at the register, and the cashier just 
asked "Two bucks okay?" to which I replied "Sure!", handing over 
two dollars plus tax ($2.18). Good deal, for a new part I would have had 
to pay $10 easily.

<pic images/weirdstuff-drop-off.ps At the back door, there's a drop-off for old electronics, which Weirdstuff either passes on to a recycling facility or sells at the store front.>

Damaged goods donated in the back Weirdstuff apparently passes on to a
<LINK>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouelqWboHLE|Recycling Center</LINK>,
where old monitors are taken apart and old circuit boards are being 
chopped up for proper disposal. Functioning components, on the other hand,
are offered for sale in the front store. The Weirdstuff guys apparently 
are operating cost-effectively, their business seems to be 
going well and whenever I'm there, there's always some customers 
rummaging through the bargain bins. A win-win situtation for everyone!

@Z: People Behaving Badly

<pic images/pbb-stanley.ps TV personality Stanley Roberts is a stickler for abiding laws.>

<em>Angelika</em>
Living in a densely populated metropolitan area often requires a lot of 
patience to get you through the day. Whenever you have a lot of people
in a crowded space, there seem to always be a small number of inconsiderate
idiots who think they own the place. Apparently, I'm not the only one
thinking this way, as the local Kron 4 station here keeps airing a segment
called "People Behaving Badly" during the daily 8 PM newscast.

<LINK>http://www.kron.com/Reporters/BehavingBadly.aspx|Stanley Roberts</LINK> is
the reporter scouting San Francisco and the surrounding area with his camera
man for people who have little 
respect for local laws or the rules of common courtesy.
Often times, he targets conspicuous drivers in Bay Area traffic, like
people who take the liberty to illegally park at bus stops or make left
turns, although they're well aware that that's not permitted at a particular
intersection.

Many quickly send a text message while waiting at a stop light, although
that's been illegal in California for quite a while now. That's also a
pet peeve of mine that makes my blood pressure go up, as those distracted
drivers often don't notice when the light goes green or suddenly 
accelerate while it's still red.

<pic images/pbb-cop.ps "People Behaving Badly" shows a police officer reminding a driver of his infractions.>

Another popular topic are dog owners, who don't put their dogs on leash
although the signs in conservation areas clearly demand so. The other day,
there was a segment on drivers on the new Bay Bridge, who clearly
used poor judgement when taking videos with one hand while crossing at
a speed of about 55 miles per hour. Some of them even had passengers, which
makes you wonder what goes on in people's heads at times. The reporter
often teams up with local police, and the camera team then follows them 
around when officers are writing tickets and hear breathtaking excuses.

Stanley Roberts exclusively targets people who do things that are clearly
illegal, but no American finds overly offensive, according to unwritten 
California laws. But behind closed doors, it seems that people do take
issue after all, which makes "People Behaving Badly" such a success, 
because Stanley Roberts seems to be the only righteous person 
who points out the culprits.

@Z: Venice Beach

<pic images/vb-see-and-be-seen.ps See and be seen on the boardwalk of Venice Beach.>

<em>Michael</em>
Residents of San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area fancy cultivating
a long tradition of absolutely hating everything about Los Angeles, but
we don't subscribe to such prejudices and travel down there every once in
a while. Also, when Americans say "Los Angeles", they actually don't mean
the downtown district, but an eclectic conglomerate of suburbs forming a 
gigantic metropolitan area home to some 20 million people. Every
single one of these neighborhoods is completely different and no
person with integrity would lump them all together and rate them as a whole.

<pic images/vb-cruiser-1.ps (#1) The sandy beaches of Venice Beach are several miles long and are best explored on a "Beach Cruiser".>

For instance, we really enjoy staying in Venice. You might have heard of
"Muscle Beach", where the early Arnold Schwarzenegger kept toning his
body at the outdoor gym on the beach way back when in the eighties.
Nowadays, hardly anyone is pushing weights there anymore, but we
rented bicycles and rode along the beach almost all the way up to Malibu.
In Figure (#1) you can admire Angelika on her beach cruiser, which
is similar to a dutch bike with an extra wide saddle and a comfortably
mounted handle bar for cruising along the board walk at the beach.
They charged a whopping $20 per day for it! Just to compare: Rental cars
in the Los Angeles area are about the same price. By the way, 
check out the basket in front of Angelika's cruiser in Figure (#1), 
you can see a backpack with a rather unassuming "Y!" logo. Don't tell
anyone, but that's the secret giveaway of someone working at Yahoo. 
Recently, someone approached us in an elevator in Las Vegas because of it.

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/vb-muscle-total.ps Has seen better times: The dumbells wielder platform on Muscle Beach.>
</HTMLONLY>

The Venice boardwalk displays an interesting mix of tourists, stranded runaways,
dubious characters, and homeless people. In winter, the area is pretty much
dead, but during the summer months the hustle and bustle until late at night
is quite appealing. On the beach, every Joe Schmoe owning a drum can join the
<LINK>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ieXzgmDCxA|Drummers of Venice Beach|Drummers of Venice Beach</LINK> and hammer away for hours to hot rhythms. 
Booth dealers sell all kinds of nicknacks, from henna tattooes to painted
skulls. The stores along the boardwalk also offer a broad array of
merchandize, from tourist shops selling t-shirts with tintillating
imprints, to tattoo parlors, or doctors who write marihuana prescriptions
for $40, to hash pipe supply shops.

<pic images/vb-doctor.ps These sales associates direct tourists to a doctor's office where they can obtain a medical marihuana prescription for 40 Dollars..>

The area isn't exactly squeaky clean, and LAPD, known for not being timid,
is always present to step in every once in a while when a crazy person
causes a disturbance, but violent outbreaks are rare. Apparently, there's
been muggings in the dark alleys near the boardwalk, but we've never
ever encountered anything of concern. Sure, every once in a while, you
have to step over a crazy homeless man who thinks it's a good idea to lay
down flat in the middle of the sidewalk, or some lunatic starts screaming
for no apparent reason, but we're somewhat used to that level of 
crazyness from living in San Francisco for almost 20 years.

<pic images/vb-dogs.ps Typical Los Angeles: the monster dog fashion trend.>

Then there's the posh neighborhood of Venice that instilled its name: 
The district with those small canals that are supposed to look like 
the waterways in Venice/Italy. Unfortunately, 
you'll only find vacation homes of 
the super rich there, which are vacant most of the time, which contributes to 
the ghost town appeal of the neighborhood, although the houses are
built in style and show tasteful interior design as well.

<pic images/vb-canal.ps Tourist sitting on a bridge in the canal district of Venice.>

What's really great about Los Angeles is its variety of absolutely 
top notch restaurants. Although the streets aren't super clean, even
the smallest hole in the wall eatery is subject to regularly recurring
checks by the health department to make absolutely sure that food
preparation and serving comply with an astonishingly strict code.
On top of that, every restaurant has to display the grade ("A" through "C")
obtained during the latest inspection boldly in its front window
(<RBLINK>20090315#4</RBLINK>). I've never seen a grade other than "A",
though, I presume no self-respecting resident of L.A. would enter
premises rated lower.

<pic images/vb-boardwalk.ps See and be seen on the Boardwalk of Venice Beach.>

And the food creations are indeed nothing short of spectacular. Especially 
in the sushi category, you have to know: Sushi restaurants in the Bay 
Area around San Francisco are about ten times better on average than 
their counterparts in Germany. What's sold as sushi in Germany wouldn't 
even pass the quality requirements for dog food over here! Then, if
you drive down to Los Angeles, you'll be surprised to find out that the
sushi creations down there are again ten times better than in the Bay 
Area. German tourists would inevitably sustain a permanent sushi shock!
If you think now "Oh god, now the old miser has completely lost it, my
super expensive Japanese restaurant in Munich serves excellent sushi", 
then I recommend you watch the documentary <LINK>http://www.magpictures.com/jirodreamsofsushi|"Jiro -- Dreams of Sushi"</LINK> and learn that serving
world class sushi requires much more than just slicing fresh fish
(which you can't even get in Munich). You read it here first.

<pic images/vb-skaters.ps What are these three teenagers up to?>

This amazing multitude of dining options creates a fierce competition
between the restaurants, resulting in highly critical patrons who
will start complaining immediately
if dishes that are not 100% satisfactory. That's a great incentive even 
for the smallest establishment to excel, because if they don't, it doesn't
take long until the word gets around on sites like
<LINK>http://yelp.com|Yelp</LINK> and they'll be forced to shut down 
because of slowing business.

<pic images/vb-wurstkueche-outside.ps Believe it or not, there's a restaurant called "Wurstküche" in Los Angeles.>

No doubt international cuisine is equally top-notch in such a melting pot of
nations. Whether it's the tiny sandwich deli around the corner or the 
spanish bodega in a small alley, or a German-infused sausage heaven named
"Wurstküche", where the barman pours a microbrew named "Zwickl" imported
from the German city of Bayreuth: There's always something special about
a place to distinguish themselves from the rest of the pack.

@Z: Poke

<pic images/poke-plate.ps Delicious raw tuna prepared with soy sauce: Shoyu Poke.>

<em>Angelika</em>
We discovered the Hawaiian dish "Poke" (pronounced "po-kah") on one of 
our trips to the islands and since we're both really into raw fish and
Japanese cuisine, it really hit it off with our taste buds. It's a very
traditional and common fish preparation technique on Hawaii, where you can
buy it at any supermarket's Poke counter, similar to cheese or meat counters
in Germany.

<pic images/poke-label.ps Even Costco in San Francisco started selling Poke at 15.99 Dollars a pound.>

Poke means "cut into small pieces", and the traditional preparation is 
cubed raw tuna, with added sauces and spices, like soy sauce, sesame oil,
sea salt or Hawaiian sea weed (limu). In some variations, the 
connoisseur finds the mild and almost sweet tasting Maui onions, or garlic.
And there's even Poke made from other types of fish, like 
octopus ("tako poke").

<pic images/poke-counter.ps The supermarket "Don Quixote" in Honolulu offers at least 20 different kinds of poke at the poke counter.>

Whenever we're on Hawaii, we eat Poke almost every day, and when we're
back in San Francicso, we miss having it. But Michael discovered the other
day, that his beloved Costco supermarket in San Francisco actually started
selling freshly made Poke. Not in as many variations as on Hawaii, but it's
a start. We started having Poke on the weekends here now every now and 
then, it's delicious!

@Z: Top product: The Jawbone Up Band

<pic images/jawbone-wrist.ps (#2) The gadget is worn like a bracelet.>

<em>Michael</em>
Sitting in the office all day is not healthy. Actively moving around is good for
you and helps avoiding putting on those otherwise inevitable pounds 
around the waistline. But how many steps are you actually walking during
the day, is it sufficient by the time you come home or should you run 
for half an hour on the tread mill or go for a late evening walk around the 
block on top of that? To find out about that, I've been wearing the bracelet
in Figure (#2) since beginning of August.

<pic images/jawbone-total.ps Didn't get enough sleep, but accomplished 10,000 steps during the day!>

The so-called Up Band by a company named Jawbone tracks how many steps
I'm going per day and how many hours of sleep I get during the night.
On my smartphone, I can then look at colorful graphics and check how
many calories I've burned, how long I've been sitting around inactively
and how many times I woke up during the night. What's more, I can program
the band to wake me up with a gently vibration when it's about time, 
but not when I'm deeply asleep, only when I'm already nervously moving 
in bed. Allegedly, waking up is less brutal this way.

<pic images/jawbone-angelika.ps Angelika's tracker data also shows up in the smartphone app.>

Since Angelika is wearing a band herself, feeds the collected data into
her smartphone, and chose to share it with me, I can now follow along 
with her sportive activities and make sarcastic comments if her step
counter shows less than the recommended 10,000 steps at the end of the day.
You can configure different goals if you like. If there's more people
in your "team", this tends to spur competition and daily new
records, because everyone wants to outperform the rest of the pack.
At work at Yahoo, my colleagues actually started to rack up miles
in the morning on training runs or hiked many miles on the weekends to
temporarily take the lead in the group.

<pic images/jawbone-night.ps Went to bed at 1:30, then a few deep sleep intervals, a few shallow ones, woke up in the morning, and fell asleep again after.>

The Up Band simply tracks acceleration data while you're swinging your
arms during walking or running activities. It won't notice whether you're 
actually moving and because of that it works just as well on a
stepper or treadmill. It guesses the covered distance more or less
accurately and if it's too far off, you can recalibrate it with 
manually entered data from an external GPS tracker like the one
built into your smartphone. Of course, you could easily trick the device
by attaching it to a crawling toddler or a pet, but that would be cheating!

<pic images/jawbone-day.ps At night, the lazy man gets busy and takes a walk down to Dolores park to fulfil the recommended number of steps.>

The new-fangled gadget is not exactly cheap at a price of $130, and 
if you have bad luck, it stops working after a while, as seen with some
of my colleagues at work. But that's the price for chasing the
latest fashion trends and being the first to try out new gadgets.
And I can confirm that the band does turn heads and is a great conversation
starter, it's very common that random people inquire about it. Top product!

Greetings from Europe's future:

Angelika \& Michael
