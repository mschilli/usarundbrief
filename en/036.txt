@Z: Rent Cars Like the Pros

<em>Michael</em> 
In our ongoing series "America by the Pros," today we present: How can
I get a rental car at a reasonable price? Typically, German
tourists book rental cars from Germany -- and that's okay because travel
agencies usually negotiate good rates. However, at the car rental
counter, things take a turn: The salesperson there will try various
tricks to drive up the price. And that's why today we'll take a close
look at what exactly goes on here in detail.

<pic images/av2.ps At the car rental return station>

In the USA, every driver needs liability insurance. Driving without
it is illegal and can end badly. When German tourists rent a car,
liability insurance with a high coverage amount is almost always
included in the rental price, as Germans are accustomed to having
liability insurance. However, make sure to read your contract
carefully!

In contrast, car rental companies in America will sell "Extended
Liability" for about $10 a day. In America, the statutory minimum
liability coverage only offers about $30,000 in coverage -- a joke!
If you hit just one pedestrian, you'll have to declare bankruptcy.
Therefore, it is important to read the contract carefully and ensure
a coverage amount of at least $500,000.

And there's another special feature: In the USA, if you own a car and
have liability insurance for it, you are generally covered not only
for your private car but for any other car you drive. This means that if
Angelika or I are driving a rental car (or a friend's car) in the USA, we
are automatically covered by our own liability insurance. If we rent a car
because, for example, we fly somewhere and want to be mobile there,
we get it without liability insurance. However, this must be
explicitly stated in your private auto liability insurance contract.

But what if someone steals the rental car or you crash it yourself?
In that case, the renter is fully liable and must not only pay for
the damage to the car but also fully compensate the rental company
for the downtime during which the company can no longer rent out the
car ("loss of use"). This can become very expensive. However, you can protect
yourself against this scenario: The rental company's insurance, called CDW
"Collision Damage Waiver" or LDW "Loss Damage Waiver," offers a type
of comprehensive coverage according to German standards for about $10
a day (depending on the size of the car) with a deductible.

If you live in the USA and have certain credit cards, things are
easier for you here as well: these cards cover liability for
self-caused accidents (only for the rental car, not for the other
party in an accident!) and theft, if you pay the car rental bill with
them. Our "American Express" card, for example, includes this in the
contract--so when we rent a car, we pay nothing beyond the listed
price. Even if the salesperson at the car rental throws a hissy fit. They
always have us sign a few forms stating that we are now fully liable for
everything. But we are always fully insured, one part through private
liability insurance and the other part through our credit card. However, not
all residents of the USA think this through. They pretend to the car rental
agent that they have private insurance, and then drive without any
insurance. If something happens, they have to deal with the American
legal system.

<pic images/ryder.ps You can even rent trucks.>

Memorize this: Never skimp on insurance. However, if you already have
insurance, the rental agent might try to talk you into buying a pointless
additional insurance policy -- so be cautious and, above all, make
sure you are familiar with the contract you signed in Germany
(usually with the travel agency). Unfortunately, among the clerks of
large car rental companies, there are many bad apples who thoroughly
deceive tourists. They take advantage of the fact that most
foreigners are not familiar with the American insurance system and,
when in doubt, can be talked into buying one insurance policy too many rather
than too few. As always, being smart gives you an advantage.

There are two more types of insurance that the agent will probably
try selling to you: "Uninsured Motorist Insurance" protects you in
case that someone without insurance crashes into your car. This is not
all that unlikely, and that's why I have to say that it might be
sensible to get this insurance, unless it's already included
somewhere else (also note that this won't cover hit and runs).
Also, the so-called "Medical" insurance, which costs only
about a dollar a day or so, is complete nonsense, as you and your
passengers hopefully have extra health insurance when traveling to
the USA; otherwise, you're already in a precarious situation.

Conclusion: Don't over-insure, but definitely don't skimp on
insurance. You could really ruin yourselves. However, this doesn't
mean you shouldn't negotiate hard with car rental companies over the
price. Rule of thumb: A small rental car costs $25 a day, CDW/LDW and
liability together add another $20. Then there are $10 in taxes and
other small fees... so if a German travel agency includes extended
liability and comprehensive insurance and charges DM 110 a day or
less -- go for it, because you won't get it cheaper in the USA
either.

Upon arriving at the counter, the salesperson will immediately try to
talk you into a "better," meaning larger, car. They will argue that,
for example, for $10 more per day, you could get a convertible.
However, this only applies to the base price, turning $25 into $35,
but the comprehensive insurance will also become significantly more
expensive, as will the tax, which is calculated as a percentage of
the total price. So when the salesperson says "$10 more per day," it
might actually end up being $20.

And another tip: If you insist on the smaller car you originally
ordered, it often turns out (surprise!) that the company doesn't
actually have it in stock. If you remain persistent, the salesperson
will eventually inform you with a beaming smile that you're getting a
free "upgrade," meaning a larger car for the price of the smaller
one. Of course, this is a bit of a gamble. For example, it might be
worth waiting at a small airport until all the tourists with small
cars have left before calmly heading to the car rental desk and
insisting on a small car. Our biggest coup so far was in Scotland,
where we got a Volvo 440 for the price of a small car for a four-week
vacation. We laughed so much!

Then the salesperson asks if you would like to buy discounted fuel
from the car rental company. Gasoline in the Bay Area currently costs
about $1.35 per gallon at the gas station (approximately 0.40 Euros per
liter), but the car rental company will sell it for $1.10 if you take
a full tank. Sounds good, right? But it's a scam. The renter has the
option to either a) return the car with a full tank, or b) buy a full
tank of gas so that you can return the car empty to the rental lot.

The problem, of course, is that you can never run the car completely
empty (unless, of course, your name is GÃ¼nter Speckhofer, who, with
his iron nerves, is known to leave only homeopathic amounts in the
tank), because who would risk running out of gas on the highway? Even
the most cunning driver will always leave at least five liters in the
tank (by then, the needle is already deep in the red) and give that
to the car rental company -- which, of course, totally ruins the
cheaper fuel price. Or, you might not be driving enough to empty the tank at all.
A person from Portland, whose identity we won't reveal here (Richard
Patten), once chose the "I buy a full tank" option for a two-day stay
in San Diego. The only way to empty the tank would have been to leave
the engine running overnight.

Therefore: Always choose the "Return full" option, meaning return the
car with a full tank, to ensure you don't end up paying extra. Some
car rental companies let customers drive away with a half-full tank
and require them to return it half-full again with the "Return full"
option. This is also a scam because no one can accurately estimate
how many liters you need to fill up to make the tank of an unfamiliar
car exactly half full.

<pic images/av1.ps (#3) Dent chart issued by the car rental company.>

What about scratches and dents? The large car rental companies
"Dollar," "Alamo," "Avis," and "Budget" are not very strict about
them. When returning the car, they usually don't even check if
there's an additional scratch. You drive up with the car, an employee
takes the contract, reads the odometer and fuel gauge, and prints a
receipt on a mobile computer -- and that's it. You take the shuttle
bus to the airport and you're on your way. Some smaller companies
(e.g., Enterprise) create a small diagram of the existing dents when
you pick up the vehicle, which you have to sign (illustration (#3)),
and this is then compared to how the vehicle looks upon return.

How can you find a good car rental deal when you're in the USA? You
can either read the Sunday newspaper and study the large-format ads
from the major providers mentioned earlier. But be careful, there is
always a so-called "code" next to the offer. If you call the car
rental company, the representative will quote you a higher price than
the one listed in the ad. However, if you provide them with the
"code" (e.g., "AQ7"), you'll get the price shown in the ad. You need
to be careful, though, as some ads are only valid for specific
locations--sometimes only at airports, sometimes only in Florida--so
read carefully.

One more thing: Cars are always rented on a daily basis. So if you
pick up the car at 7:00 PM, you should also state 7:00 PM as the
return time. If you say 6:00 PM as the return time, you'll have to
return the car an hour earlier unnecessarily, without saving any
money. If you do show up at the car rental at 6:00 PM, it's not a
problem. Conversely, if you pick up the car at 7:00 PM and state 8:00
PM as the pickup time, the car rental company will charge you for an
entire extra day! By the way, if you want to keep the car longer than
planned, just call them; they'll usually allow it. The same applies in
case of an accident: call the car rental company immediately and ask
for advice, as their call centers are staffed around the clock.

When making a rental reservation by phone, you don't have to pay anything
upfront. They will only ask if you will be paying later with a "major
credit card" -- such as American Express, Visa, or Mastercard. You
will then receive a reservation number, which you can use to simply
show up at the car rental location later. By the way, the websites
have also improved recently. I've found some great deals on
www.dollar.com. You can make a firm booking there and then go to the
respective branch with the printed reservation.

There, you present your driver's license and credit card and acquire
the necessary insurance. By the way, the agent might ask you not only
to sign the contract at the bottom but also to place your "initials"
at certain spots. By putting your initials (e.g., "M.S.") there, you
agree to the respective clauses, and you can't later claim you hadn't
read them. If there are two or more of you, you need to inform the
agent who will be driving. Usually, only the person listed in the
contract is insured. There are exceptions for married couples, but
always ask and present the driver's license -- all drivers must be
present in person. Often, an additional driver costs money, $3 per
day is common. And a warning to our dear youngsters: Those under 25
or so have to pay more. Then you get the key, go to the garage, and
are assigned a car. By the way, it always comes with automatic transmission and perfumed
with an interior spray -- phew! And off you go!

So, that should be enough to keep you from falling for the car rental scammers.
Yes, I am not afraid to shout this out to the world: All American car rental
companies are trying to take advantage of you! Or are very, um, business-savvy,
as the Americans say. Fight with tough measures!

@Z: German Influences in America

<em>Michael</em> Have you ever seen that some cars have a small plastic wind
deflector stuck to the frame of the front side window? According to the
"Herrington Catalog," this is "typically European" and is called a
"Wind-und-StÃ¼rm-Shield" (illustration (#9)). You can often find such
absurdities because Americans think: If it has lots of umlauts, it's got to be
German! And everything that comes from Germany has an unchecked quality bonus
here.  You wouldn't believe how proud some Americans are to drive not just a BMW or
Mercedes, but even just a Volkswagen! A Jetta driver in the USA enjoys about
the same reputation as an Alfa Romeo or MG driver in Germany: young, dynamic,
sporty, slightly exotic.

<pic images/kata2.ps (#9) The "Wind-and-StÃ¼rm" plastic thing>

<pic images/kata1.ps The car cleaning product "Klasse">

But that brings me to an interesting topic: the incorporation of
German words into the English language, and that's not as uncommon as you'd think.
In Germany, people often use English words to appear cool. "Networking"
instead of "Kontakte knÃ¼pfen," for example. On the other hand,
German words in the English language mainly serve to make the author of
an article, who is already using unusual words, appear particularly
educated, as perhaps only 5% of Americans understand them.

The "New Yorker," for example, is a weekly magazine read not only in
New York City but nationwide, featuring lengthy articles that even I,
after five years in America, still have to work through with a
dictionary. Or do any of you newsletter-reading know-it-alls perhaps
know what "impetuous," "to imbue," "swashbuckler," "prescience,"
"apt," or "to rummage" mean? "Portend," "putative," "to loathe," or
"tizzy"? Ha! But what I actually wanted to
say is: Americans sometimes use German words to express things for
which there is no English word. "Schadenfreude," for example. It's
mentioned in the book "Word Freak" by Stefan Fatsis (figure (#12)).
You heard that right, there is no English word for the most
beautiful of all joys! Or "DoppelgÃ¤nger." It was recently in The New
Yorker (illustration (#10)).

<pic images/schadenf.ps (#12) The word "schadenfreude" appears in a New Yorker article.>

<pic images/doppel.ps (#10) The word "doppelgÃ¤nger" is used in English>

Now, there actually is the word "look-alike" for people who bear a striking
resemblance to others (usually celebrities), but the eerie notion
that there is someone who not only looks like you but also leads a
similar life and perhaps has even stolen the original's identity is a
nightmare expressed only by the word "doppelgÃ¤nger." I don't
need to elaborate on "Kindergarten," as everyone knows that one anyway.

<pic images/schtick.ps (#14) The word "schtick" in a film review>

Some American expressions that sound somewhat German also originate
from Yiddish. For example, when the well-known film critic Roger
Ebert writes about the old film "Dead Poet's Society",
stating that the main actor Robin Williams oscillates
between "restraint and schtick" (illustration (#14)), educated
Americans understand that Williams fluctuates between restraint and
gimmicky routine. In colloquial usage, a "schtick" is either a
characteristic "piece" of something or a gimmick that someone
repeatedly performs. What, you don't believe me? In illustration
(#15), you can see the entry in Webster's Dictionary, the "Duden" of
the English-speaking world. It explains that "schtick" or "shtick" is
Yiddish and originally comes from German. Another example is "to
schlep" for schleppen: "I don't like to schlep my bags!" is quite
understandable English if you encounter someone with at least a basic
education.
On the <LINK>http://koshernosh.com/yiddish.htm|Koshernosh</LINK> website
you will find the most common phrases.

<pic images/schdict.ps (#15) The word "schtick" in the dictionary>

And some expressions may sound like their German "doppelgÃ¤ngers,"
but they mean something slightly different: "Spiel," for example.
When an American says "we went through the same spiel again," they
mean that the same performance or routine happened again. And the
English word "angst" doesn't exactly mean the German fear, but rather
existential anxiety with a Freudian (or whatever kind of
psychological) undertone.

Recently, in a meeting where Dieter (the other Bavarian at Netscape)
and I were sitting with about ten other people, the head of quality
assurance wanted to report on something a manager with the rather
German-sounding name "Rick Gruenhagen" (an American) had said -- and
accidentally called him "Rick Grugenheimer." Grugenheimer! Dieter and
I couldn't hold back. We laughed until we both had tears in our eyes.
And for the next 15 minutes, no one could say anything because every
time we looked at each other, one of us would start laughing again.
The participants in the meeting who had dialed in over the phone had
no idea what was going on. And even today, when I say "Grugenheimer!"
we burst into laughter.

And something else: Sometimes advertisements come to the house by mail that
make me laugh my head off. Maybe it's because I'm easily amused, but
a vacuum cleaner named "ORECK" -- I just can't help myself.

<pic images/oreck.ps (#4) The Super Vacuum Cleaner "ORECK">

I scanned the direct mail item for the dear newsletter audience in
illustration (#4) -- please send your humor ratings! In Germany, it
probably wouldn't sell, as the risk of confusion with
the word "Dreck" (dirt) is too great. This reminds me of the story
about the German cat food "Kinky," which an advertising agency
supposedly withdrew at the last moment in the eighties because
"Kinky" simply means "perverse" in English.

@Z: The Mormon Temple of San Diego

<pic images/moc.ps (#6) Visible from the highway: The Mormon Temple in San Diego>

<em>Michael</em> 
Some time ago, we flew down to San Diego for a few days. A drive on
the highway down there took us past the pointy temple shown in illustration
(#6). We remembered our journalistic duties as newsletter reporters,
took the next exit, and approached the brilliantly white structure.
It turned out to be a Mormon temple, or as it is called here in the
USA, the "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." The building
was surrounded by a tall white fence, but a sign invited us to a free
tour of the grounds and pointed to the gate, which looked like the
one at the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe. We parked,
walked along the fence to the gate, where we were greeted by an older
gentleman who introduced himself as "Bob" from "Utah." He said that
"Sister Rebecca" would take care of us shortly, as soon as she was
finished with the other group she was with. Despite Angelika's
eye-rolling, I asked (but politely!) how long it would take, but was
reassured that it would be soon.

<pic images/tem.ps (#5) The newsletter reporters were allowed into the courtyard.>

"Sister Rebecca" turned out to be the wife of "Bob" and guided us
through the temple's gardens. The temple is the sanctuary of the
Mormons and is visited by followers of the religion only on special
occasions, such as for weddings. Otherwise, the faithful gather in
more ordinary buildings for Sunday church services. We were not
allowed inside the temple, but upon inquiry, we learned that as a
Mormon, you receive a small card that grants you access. Angelika was
somewhat informed and knew that Mormons do not consume alcohol or
caffeine, and as a coffee enthusiast, she asked how it was with
coffee and such. Alcohol and coffee are indeed taboo, came the
response (at this point, I had already dismissed the whole thing),
but Coca-Cola is quite acceptable in America. Interesting! We found
it difficult to leave, as various people kept offering us a video
they wanted to send to our home address -- but we stood firm and
left.

@Z: Jarritos -- Top Product!

<em>Michael</em> 
Whenever I work from home, I get a burrito for lunch from the Mexican
eatery around the corner. The sales dialogue is always the same:
"Burrito to go on a wheat flour tortilla, please. Cheese? No cheese.
What kind of beans? Refried beans. What kind of meat? Steak. Anything
else? Mild salsa, guacamole, sour cream, please." Translation for
non-Californians: Burrito (wheat pancake roll with filling), no
cheese, refried beans, shredded beef, mild salsa (tomatoes and
cilantro, slightly spicy), guacamole (avocado-based paste), and sour
cream. The burrito then costs about five dollars, I eat half of it, and
Angelika warms up the other half in the microwave in the evening when
she comes home from photography school. I've been doing this once a
week for about four years now. But recently, I discovered another treat
in the Mexican's refrigerated section: the "Jarritos" soda.

<pic images/jarritos.ps The Mexican woodruff soda from Jarritos>

A genuine "Product of Mexico," as the label indicates, and certainly
made with additives that are not permitted in Germany. How else could
this delicious lemonade in the "Lemon" version taste like the
woodruff soda that was available at kiosks in German swimming pools
in the seventies? If you ever find yourself in California or Mexico,
you absolutely must try it. Oh, all the sweetness of youth is
contained in this bottle!

@Z: Marathon and chocolate

<pic images/svm1.ps (#19) Mr. Muscle at the Silicon Valley Marathon Relay>

<em>Michael</em> 
If you can't complete a full marathon, you can also divide it into
four parts and run it as a relay in America. Some colleagues at
Netscape had urged me to run the last 6.9-mile leg of the Silicon
Valley Marathon in San Jose. For an old marathon veteran, 11.1
kilometers are, of course, not a challenge, so I completed them in
just 57 minutes. If you enlarge image (#19), you can see my brutal
leg muscles during the final sprint!

<pic images/schoko.ps (#11) We are stocked up on chocolate.>

Shortly before Christmas, our mailman had to carry a heavy load
because all the packages that arrived from Germany -- our neighbor's
children were already getting really curious. Thanks to everyone who
showered us with gifts -- apparently, word got around that we love
Milka chocolate, which isn't available here. Figure (#11) shows the
haul -- we're well-stocked now, many thanks to everyone! Make way for
Angelika!

@Z: GeisterstÃ¤dte

<pic images/bodie2.ps The Ghost Town of Bodie>

<em>Angelika</em> 
Currently, a campaign is sweeping across the country with the goal of
attracting more tourists to America. American celebrities are
promoting the beauty of the United States and hope to halt the
decline in tourism following the terrorist attacks and to stimulate
the sluggish economy. Traveling and shopping are now considered
patriotic behaviors here in the USA! However, we are not driven by
patriotic motives to explore the world -- our goal is to discover as
much of California as possible while we live here. During one of our
short trips in California, we visited the former gold mining town of
"Bodie" recently -- a so-called ghost town.

<pic images/bodie1.ps An old living room in the ghost town Bodie>

Bodie is located in the middle of the Californian outback, close
to the Nevada border and about 100 miles northeast of Yosemite
National Park. As our somewhat aging car struggled over mountain
passes and the last three miles of unpaved road, we kept asking
ourselves what had motivated people back in the day to pitch their tents
in this rugged terrain. Naturally, it was the lure of gold. But the
winters in this region are extremely harsh (yes, that exists in
California too). Even today, the towns are cut off from the rest of
the world for months because the passes over the Sierra Nevada
mountain range are impassable. In 1859, gold was discovered in a town
called Bodie. At the height of the gold rush, around 1879, about
10,000 people lived in Bodie. It had, among other things, 65
saloons. After the gold mines were exhausted, the residents gradually
left Bodie, taking what they could carry but also leaving a lot
behind. Due to its isolated location, much has remained as the
residents had left it: in some cases, the dishes are still in the
cupboards. Although only about five percent of the buildings still
stand today, it took us hours to see everything. The buildings are
not restored, but only minimally maintained, for example, they're supported
if they are in danger of collapsing. Western movie enthusiasts or die-hard
fans of the TV series "Little House on the Prairie" will be in
seventh heaven in Bodie. I wouldn't have been surprised to run into
Laura Ingalls. If you're in the area, check out Bodie.

<pic images/bodie3.ps Display of a pharmacy in Bodie.>

@Z: State of the Nation

<em>Angelika</em> 
Regarding the State of the Nation: There is currently a lot of
commotion in San Francisco and its surroundings about John Walker,
who has been exposed as an American Taliban fighter by the media. The
20-year-old American grew up in wealthy Marin County, the district
just outside San Francisco (north of the Golden Gate Bridge), and
had converted to Islam in his early teenage years. After stops in various
Arab countries, he eventually ended up in Afghanistan, where he was
captured by US troops in early December. Walker is suspected of
having fought alongside the Taliban and Al Qaeda and is therefore
charged with conspiracy and the murder of Americans, as well as
aiding terrorism, which could result in a life sentence if convicted.

In San Francisco, we occasionally hear some sarcastic comments on
Marin County having produced a Taliban member. This is because San
Francisco has always looked down on Marin County: "too white" and
"too rich" is the unanimous verdict. John Walker, offspring of a
wealthy lawyer, fits this image. On a national level, "Johnny"
sparked a heated debate about the honor of being an American citizen.
Many were so outraged by his behavior that they would prefer to strip
him of his citizenship immediately: John Walker as public enemy
number one. Others were more charitable, emphasizing that he is a
young man ideologically confused, but one must not forget that he is
an American. As a neutral observer, I find it interesting that Walker
was not taken to the American military base in Cuba like the Afghan
prisoners, but rather kept on American soil. He is also expected to
face the federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, and not a military
tribunal. This raises the suspicion that the US government sees him
more as a lost son.

Regarding confused young men: Surely you've also heard in Germany that a
15-year-old in Florida attempted to imitate the terrorist attacks on
the World Trade Center in order to commit suicide. He flew a small
plane into the Bank of America building in Tampa. Allegedly, he
expressed admiration for Osama Bin Laden in his farewell letter.
Immediately, there was a discussion about security regulations at
airports with private planes and an investigation into what led to
the suicide. Even the 15-year-old's acne medication was scrutinized,
as it is suspected of causing severe depression. I was amazed to see
that no one questioned the fact that a 15-year-old in this country is
allowed to learn to fly, even though in most states he couldn't
legally purchase alcohol because he was under 21. Surely he was only
allowed to fly with an instructor, but it shows how easy it was for
the 15-year-old to outsmart the instructor and take off alone in the
Cessna.

@Z: Politically Correct

<em>Angelika</em> 
And yet another all-American controversy unfolded in New York last
week. There was a consideration to erect a bronze statue in honor of
the firefighters who perished in action after the attack on the World
Trade Center. It was decided to use the three firefighters who raised
a huge American flag shortly after the attack as a model for the
bronze figures (including the flag). The problem was that the real
three firefighters were all white. This was deemed politically
incorrect, and--just like that--it was decided to depict one white,
one black, and one Latino firefighter. The firefighters in New York
promptly protested, arguing that this completely distorted the actual
event. Others countered that it was not about depicting reality but
about the symbolic content. The fact is that almost the entire corps
of firefighters in New York is composed of white individuals, which
is surprising given that all skin colors are represented in New York.
In any case, the project was initially put on hold. The artist is now
considering other design possibilities.

Behaving politically correct is considered good manners, especially
here in San Francisco; however, sometimes it can lead to some peculiar
outcomes. But in principle, it's a good thing not to act like an
insensitive oaf and, for example, to choose your words carefully. To
prepare you for your next visit to America, here's a quick "crash
course": Black Americans are referred to as "African American." You
should definitely avoid using the terms that Black people use among
themselves if you have a different skin color, as these are interpreted
as insults.

Instead of "Indian", Americans refer to "Native Americans." The word
"Indian" nowadays characterizes a person who comes from India.
Referring to Asians as "Oriental" will earn you many disapproving
looks; the correct term is "Asian-American." In general, caution is
advised: not every person who looks Asian comes from China, so it's
better to choose the broader category "Asian American."

People from Latin America are referred to here as either "Latinos" or
"Hispanics," with endless discussions about which term is better.
This debate begins with the definition of Latin America itself: Which
countries are included, and which are not? Many are bothered by the
fact that the term "Hispanic" emphasizes Spanish roots too much, as
Spain ultimately dominated and oppressed Latin America. Others feel
that both terms are overly generalized, so many Mexicans living here,
for example, prefer to be called "Mexican American" or something
similar. But, at the moment, neither "Latino" nor "Hispanic" is
completely off the mark.

When filling out official forms in America, one typically encounters
the phenomenon of having to check off their ethnic affiliation. This
still feels strange to me and not politically correct at all. I
remember the first time I came across the term "Caucasian" and had no
idea what it meant. In my desperation, I checked the "Other" category
and wrote "white" on the corresponding line, which later turned out
to be unnecessary because "Caucasian" means exactly that. By the way,
the "Other" category is now included on every form, as many people
find it difficult to assign themselves to a specific ethnic group
and/or terminology.

@Z: Consequences of September 11

<em>Angelika</em> 
But now, once again, back to New York. Recently, the city erected an
observation platform at the former World Trade Plaza to allow
onlookers to view the destroyed area known as "Ground Zero," where
the Twin Towers once stood. Due to the massive influx of visitors,
they are now issuing tickets, which, it should be noted, are free of
charge. Still, the question remains: is it disrespectful or
pragmatic? I'll leave the answer to you.

And yet another curiosity I've noticed more frequently lately:
TV shows set in New York are incorporating the events of September
11th. When you watch series like "Law and Order" (a crime series
where the police and prosecutor work together to solve a murder) or
NYPD Blue (also in the crime genre, NYPD stands for New York Police
Department; it always involves a murder that the members of the New
York homicide squad have to solve), you often hear the actors
referencing the terrorist attacks. One episode even went so far as to
have someone try to cover up the murder of a woman by claiming she
died in the World Trade Center. It's quite remarkable how quickly the
scriptwriters are integrating these events into their stories.

<pic images/lo.ps The TV show "Law & Order">

@Z: Operation Dragnet

<em>Angelika</em> 
What the "Rasterfahndung" is to the Germans, "racial profiling" is to
the Americans. This term refers to singling out a person solely based
on their ethnic background, skin color, or nationality.
Theoretically, "racial profiling" is prohibited. Therefore,
police are not allowed to identify, stop, or arrest someone simply
because of their skin color. However, in practice, there are frequent
reports of this happening, particularly to young black men. "Racial
profiling" has become a hot topic again since Attorney General
Ashcroft ordered 5,000 foreigners, who are in the U.S. on tourist,
business, or student visas, to be questioned in connection with the
terrorist attacks. These individuals are primarily men between the
ages of 18 and 33 from the Middle East. Although Ashcroft
preemptively emphasized that those interviews are voluntary and that
those men are not considered suspects, this is precisely what makes it
"racial profiling," as nationality alone determines who was invited
for the interview. Criticism of this approach came from an unusual
source. The police chief of Portland, Oregon, refused to locate 200
men in his area who were to be questioned, as he believed the ordered
interviews did not comply with his state's laws. In Oregon,
police are prohibited from questioning a person about their political
or religious views unless the person is suspected of a crime and the
questions could help solve it. However, the catalogue of standardized
interview questions aimed to investigate political and religious standpoints.
Among other things, Ashcroft expects information on how the person
felt when they heard about the September 11 attacks and whether they
sympathized with the hijackers. Another question aims to find out
which cities and landmarks those individuals had visited in the U.S. How
one could infer potential terrorism from this answer is a mystery to
me. After all, anyone who visited New York, for example, also went to
the observation deck of the World Trade Center. Incidentally, the
police chief of San Francisco also refused to assist with the
interviews.

But in the fight against terrorism, it's not just the stick that's
wielded in this country; the carrot is also offered: Foreigners who
provide useful information leading to the capture of terrorists are
enticed with the possibility of immigrating to the USA. Since 1994,
there has been a special visa category that allows an individual to stay in the
country for three years, even if they are currently residing illegally in the
USA. The idea is not foolish, as individuals who are in the country
illegally often remain silent out of fear of being deported. Attorney
General Ashcroft assured that even individuals who are not currently
in the USA can expect to receive this special visa: Any American embassy
will accept useful information regarding terrorists. And although the
visa is only valid for three years, Ashcroft even hinted at the
possibility of American citizenship for informants in the long term.
However, how this would be achieved remains unclear.

@Z: Snow in Silicon Valley

<em>Angelika</em> 
Now, to a completely non-political yet extraordinary event: It snowed
today (January 28th) south and north of San Francisco. However, San
Francisco itself was spared from the white wonder. Since snowfall only
occurs in this region once every few decades, everyone was thrilled.
Even the local news anchors and weather experts had a childlike gleam
in their eyes. For many children, it was the first snow they had ever
seen. In Petaluma (located north of San Francisco), they happily
built snowmen, and in many areas, schools were closed due to the
snow. What a joyful day.

In this sense, many greetings from the currently bitterly cold San Francisco!
