@Z: Cooking crab in Jordan's Kitchen

<pic images/crab-duo.ps Two five-star cooks on the quest for the Michelin star.>

<em>Angelika</em>
It's really not easy to find a present for Michael, as he has the bad
habit of buying everything himself, especially as short a week before his
birthday or Christmas.

He's reading books, but exclusively as e-books, and instead of listening
to CDs, he prefers streaming services like "Spotify" or "Rhapsody". That
makes finding presents for him extremely difficult, and I've been 
surprising him with joint adventures instead.

Because Michael likes to cook and I once enjoyed taking cooking classes a long
long time ago, my gift to him this year was a cooking class for the both of 
us. After researching quite a bit, I found 
<LINK>http://jordanskitchensf.com|"Jordan's Kitchen"</LINK> just around
the corner from us in the Mission neighborhood. Jordan, a famous chef, 
offers four hour classes teaching how to prepare a four course meal.
Since Michael and I love
<LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeness_crab|"Dungeness Crab"</LINK>,
and we've always wanted to know how to cook them starting from scratch, so I
signed up for the "Crab Cookout".

<pic images/crab-pot.ps The Dungeness Crab are cooking for about 12 minutes in boiling water until they're ready to be served.>

Dungeness Crab are native to the San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean
close to the U.S. west coast, harvesting 
season is typically between November and June. 
They are truly gargantuan in size, the massive body harness measures between six
and eight inches in diameter and the whole crab 
weighs about 2 pounds. Our cooking class
happened at the end of January, there were fourteen students and chef Jordan
told us everything there is to know about cooking crab. We had such a great
time! At first I had some doubts whether I would dare to grab a living
crab and place it in boiling water, but we learned that you need to snatch
the crab from behind so that it can't get your fingers with its claws and 
bravely I gave in to group pressure.

<pic images/crab-ice.ps After cooking the crab are placed in ice water.>

Interestingly enough, the clawed creatures first seemed quite apathic,
but started fidgeting as soon as we picked them up. When quickly 
submerged in boiling water, they stopped immediately, thankfully.
We were sipping some wine during the class, and the participants were
all pretty relaxed. Jordan also demonstrated how to take out the 
inedible parts of the cooked crab. We removed the upper plate, and took
out intestines like the lungs. There's some meat in the crab body as well,
which can be pulled out after cutting the carcass in quarters, but the main
source are the crab's claws and its eight feet, 
and getting to the delicious meat inside requires cracking their hard 
outer shells first.

<pic images/crab-legs.ps Now the Dungeness Crab needs to be cleaned and dismantled.>

Here's the list of the four courses we cooked: 
Dungeness crab meat in coconut milk on cucumber slices; 
Bucatini pasta with crab meat; roasted crab in orange and garlic butter;
apple and pear compote with cornflower croutons. What was nice was
that all participants cooked and later ate as one big team. And I 
received a personal training from Jordan on how to use a chef's knife!
Highly recommended class!

@Z: Montreal, Canada

<pic images/montreal-arret.ps They speak French in Montreal.>

<em>Michael</em>
In December this year, we traveled to Canada. This time, we set out 
to explore the French-speaking part on the east coast and first had 
a stop-over after a five hour flight in Toronto. According to several
previous experiences, Canadian immigration personnel are about the 
unfriendliest people on earth, and living up to our expectations, 
the person behind the counter greeted us this time by balking
"What do you want in Canada?!" at us. Luckily, we know how to deal with 
this kind of situation. But, really, Canada?

When we asked our cab driver on the way from the airport to downtown 
Montreal if he spoke English, and we of course asked in French,
he laughingly exclaimed: "No!" and we set out to explain that we only 
spoke very little French. The rest of the ride resumed in silence. I 
still remembered French numbers from school way back when pretty well, 
so I could at least tell him how much I was willing to pay for the ride
including tip as we safely arrived.

<pic images/montreal-mural-red.ps Montreal is a colorful city.>
<pic images/montreal-2nd-floor-stairs.ps Typical Montreal: Small houses with a separate entrance for the 2nd floor.>

We were truly shocked that except for a few American tourists everyone
speaks French in Montreal. Every store you enter, the first thing
you hear is "Bonjour!" and if you don't clue people in, they start 
throwing French at you at a speed that is really hard to understand
for non-native speakers. For what it's worth, I have spent a solid 
five years of my life learning French, in a high school in Germany from 7th to 
11th grade, four hours a week. Admittedly, French in school never resonated 
with me and I ended up with barely passing grades, but this illustrates
fairly well that there's certain areas where the German education system 
went right by me without much effect.

<pic images/montreal-house-comic.ps At outside temperatures of -1C (30F) the colorful houses of Montreal sure look nice in the sunshine.>

But if the visitor then carefully inquires if their vis-Ã -vis might 
perhaps speak English ("Parlez-vous Anglais?"), it turns out that every 
native under 30 does so fluently. We found out that apparently
French-Canadians get upset when visitors automatically assume that everyone 
speaks English. It seems a bit strange, but, hey, when in Rome.

Another oddity are the store opening hours, which are rather European than
American. For example, we went to this grocery store right 
by the train station,
and knowing they might be closing early on a Saturday, we inquired about 
how long they were open, and learned while gnashing our teeth that they 
would close at 5pm. To make sure we still would be able to get our groceries
for the weekend, we showed up at 4:15pm and saw to our surprise that the 
meat counter was virtually sold out and the cheese fridge had already be
covered up with protective tarp. Luckily, we had been there the day before,
knew where everything was located, and were able to direct a sales person 
to the sealed-off areas in order to get a few items for our evening meal.

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/montreal-house.ps Colorfully painted old house in a Montreal side street.>
</HTMLONLY>

In one store, we inquired if there was a bakery nearby. All the clerks stuck 
their heads together, and started a lively discussion in French. After
some back and forth, from what we understood there were several shopping 
malls that were evaluated, they concluded that it was 
too complicated to explain, and no, they were sorry, but they couldn't 
tell us where the next bakery was. Wha-what? 
We found this quite strange, because,
I mean, if someone asked us in downtown San Francisco where the next 
bakery was, most likely we'd be scratching our heads a bit because 
high rents typically drive bakeries to the outskirts, but we would
certainly be able to give directions on how to get to the nearest location.

<pic images/cornichons.ps Take as many pickles from the jar as you want, and then return it.>

And having lived for decades in the United States, we noticed a few 
stunning small differences in the French part of Canada: Sales clerks 
handling food aren't wearing gloves like back in the States. When we dined
at a really good French bistro in Montreal one day, the waiter placed a 
gigantic jar with pickles on our table, and we extracted as many gherkins as we
liked by using a pair of big wooden tongs provided for this purpose.
When we were done, the waiter took the jar away, only to set it down
at a different party's table! This would never fly in the U.S., the health
department would start issuing violations and patrons would freak out!
As born Europeans, we liked it, of course.

In the excellent "Beaver Hall" restaurant, named after the street it
is located on, the waiter placed a whole loaf of bread on our table after
we ordered, and put a gigantic bread knife with a serrated blade next to it.
Imagine that to happen in the U.S., the restaurant owner would certainly
worry about clumsy or reckless guests injuring themselves and having to
deal with the resulting liability issues and million-dollar lawsuits!

Across the board, dining in the French part of Canada is a truly eye-opening
experience, the food was truly excellent whereever we went. 
It's not exactly cheap but well worth the money, and the patrons are 
dressed up much fancier than in the U.S., although you can only tell after 
they've taken off their puffball-sized down jackets, which the waiters
quickly put away to place them in the coat check area.

<pic images/montreal-macrons.ps Expensive cookies with filling, called "macrons".>

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/montreal-macrons-box.ps All macrons have to fit exactly into the box.>
</HTMLONLY>

Another French specialty are the so-called "Macrons". Those two-layered 
cookies feature fillings of all kinds of flavors, and they're packed into
small 
cardboard boxes by the dozen. Allegedly, they're really complicated to make,
which is why, so the rumor goes, one cookie the size of a postage stamp 
costs more than a dollar. They're not bad, but I'd hardly drive all the way 
up to Canada to taste them. The sales person packs exactly one dozen 
into a small rectangular box, and if they don't fit all in, 
they're being squeezed until they do. 

<pic images/montreal-notre-dames-bon-secour.ps Over night, Montreal was suddenly covered in snow. This is a tiny church in Montreal's Old Town named Notre Dames Bon Secour.>

After three cold, but sunny days (always around 32F), all of a sudden, one
morning, there were four inches of snow on the ground. We had done our homework
and brought our Alaska gear to Montreal, so we just bundled up and grudgingly
trudged through the slushy snow on the sidewalks. Interestingly, traffic was
largely unimpacted.

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/montreal-saq-opening-hours.ps The government-controlled liquor store has inconvenient opening hours and closes at 5pm on Sundays!>
</HTMLONLY>

When it comes to retailing alcoholic beverages, Canada features some of
the most absurd regulations known to man. Details vary from state to state, 
so for example in the city of Montreal, 
located in the state of Quebec, supermarkets
are legally allowed to sell wine and beer, but no hard liquor. A 
government-controlled store chain named "SAQ" (<LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_des_alcools_du_Qu%C3%A9bec|SociÃ©tÃ© des alcools du QuÃ©bec</LINK>), on the other hand, offers wine, beer, and hard liquor in a 
somewhat elevated price category. Their store hours aren't exactly 
customer friendly, though, for example, they're closing at 5pm on Sundays!

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/montreal-apportez-votre-vin.ps "Apportez votre vin": You can bring your own wine to this restaurant.>
</HTMLONLY>

Restaurants often have a liquor license, but many don't, and by displaying
a "Apportez votre vin" sigh, they're inviting customers to bring their own 
wine, usually purchased from a nearby store. Unlike in the U.S., they
usually don't charge a "corking fee". It's a very good deal, as wines
that cost $10 retail a bottle are often listed for $50 on the wine
menu.

<pic images/montreal-foie-gras.ps (#2) In Montreal with its French influence, of course you can get foie gras.>

As you might know, selling foie gras in California has been outlawed about
a year ago (<RBLINK>20121103#10</RBLINK>). Other states, for example
Nevada, still offer it, and, as you've probably guessed, it's a staple on the
menus in many French Canadian restaurants. Whenever the government takes
something away, the natural reaction is to crave it, and when we saw
that $25 can of foie gras on a christmas market in Montreal, we had to get
it. Applied as spread on cruncy European-style bread sold at the
"Premier Moisson" bakerey which, against all odds, we managed to find
anyway, it tasted fabulous.

<pic images/montreal-jump.ps Even at frosty temperatures, Michael has to goof off.>

@Z: Quebec, Canada

<em>Michael</em>
Four days later, we hauled our rolling luggage on partially de-iced sidewalks 
to the train station "Gare Central", located about half a mile from our hotel.
We were heading to Quebec, about 160 miles north-east of Montreal. The city
of Quebec is referred to by "Quebec City" by Canadians to avoid confusion as
both Montreal and Quebec City are located in the Canadian state of Quebec.
Bulky luggage wasn't permitted in the train vestibules, so we dropped
ours off at the baggage check, just like at the airport. There wasn't any
annoying rigamarole like having to show ID or being chased through a body
scanner. Since we had our passports in hand, the baggage handler even 
jokingly snatched them and hid them behind his back! Most travelers boarded
the train 30 minutes before departure. The train wasn't going very fast,
only about 60 miles per hour, but offered a stable and
pretty speedy Wifi connection.

<pic images/quebec-train-baggage.ps In Quebec we received our bags at the luggage car located at the head of the train.>

As soon as we got off the train in Quebec, we noticed that the 
outside temperature had gone down from "frosty" to "brutally cold". 
During our stay, we experienced cold snaps with temperatures 
as low as -14F (-26C), and if you're outside on such a day and the
cold wind is blowing in your face, this gets old pretty quickly.

<pic images/quebec-castle-ice-river.ps The city wall and the old castle hotel in Quebec.>

Quebec is an astonishingly old city, at least it seems so when you're visiting
from the United States. Its history dates back to the 17th century, and its old
town at the top of the hill is called "Haute-Ville", connected
to the lower part "Basse-Ville" by both an ancient elevator and a regular
road.

<pic images/quebec-angelika-cannons.ps Angelika is freezing next to old cannons in Quebec.>

There's many ancient cannons standing around everywhere throughout the city 
and all kinds of old masonry for the curious visitor to inspect. 
From what we've heard, during the summer months, Quebec turns into a 
possibly hard to bear tourist location, with all kinds of buzzling
festivals and packed stores and restaurants. During the winter months, however,
it is charminging bleary, and the few restaurants still open bid a warm 
welcome to visitors, and will happily walk them through the entire menu
in English if that is what it takes.

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/quebec-billboard.ps The sunlight comes in horizontally, and in combination with the cold clear air provides excellent conditions for photographers.>
</HTMLONLY>

It's a photographer's paradise. The sun usually hangs low on the horizon,
casting an almost horizontal light, which creates a grandiose ambience.
The air is crystal clear, due to the extreme cold, and the only hard
part is hitting the release without taking off the mittens! Hitting the
button on a pedestrian crossing light while wearing mittens poses the
same problem, but Quebec solved this one by placing sensors next to the 
buttons and all you need to do to trigger the signal is to hold your
mitten next to it (Figure (#4)).

<pic images/quebec-glove-switch.ps (#4) Pedestrian crossings feature these proximity sensors that trigger the light when an object like a mitten-protected hand gets near it.>

We found Canada's French-speaking part way more interesting than its
western parts, which are mainly a pretty lame version of similar 
American cities. Vancouver or Toronto are not more than a poor man's 
San Francisco, and can be safely skipped, but travelers exploring Canada's 
east side will find a truly unique culture. We got a refresher in speaking
French and ate a lot of excellent food. In Montreal, for example, I had
a Filet Mignon so undescribably tender that I can't name a place which 
serves anything even remotely comparable. Beware, though, 
that French Canadians use a lot of butter in their cuisine, which can
make you feel a bit bloated after a while. People are very friendly there, just
don't forget to always start a conversation in French, even if it's just
asking for a table for two in a restaurant. After the initial ice breaker, you
can safely switch to English.

@Z: The Tech Bus

<pic images/shuttle-yahoo.ps The Yahoo shuttle clearly states which company is running it.>

<em>Michael</em>
In the beginning, there was only the Google bus. Dating back to
2008 (<RBLINK>20080502#5</RBLINK>), the Internet giant has been picking up 
employees all over San Francisco and is driving them down to Silicon
Valley every day. And even back then, upset neighbors complained about the dark
heavy luxury buses, roaming through small residential streets in the
early morning hours, some of them letting their engines idle for ten 
minutes while waiting. The gossip site <LINK>http://allthingsd.com/20130721/san-francisco-may-crack-down-on-corporate-shuttle-buses|Allthingsd ran the story "San Francisco May Crack Down on Corporate Shuttle Buses"</LINK> back then and
rumored the San Francisco might soon be imposing new regulation for the tech
buses.

<pic images/shuttle-gbus.ps With "GBUS MTV" on the display, the Google shuttle indicates somewhat cryptically that it's destined for the Google campus in Mountain View.>

Nowadays, every big Silicon Valley company offers shuttles as a perk, because
they're all aware that tech workers who are forced to commute during rush hour
between 7:30 and 9:00 in the morning on the chronically clogged freeways 101
and 280, will sooner or later either go bananas or look for different
employment opportunities directly in the city. Today, I'll let you in on which
company is running which bus, as most of them are unmarked and only employees
know their shuttles and where they're headed.  Actually, on
<LINK>http://sfist.com/2012/09/25/behold_the_secret_corporate_shuttle.php|sfist.com</LINK>
someone went through the exercise of following the shuttles on their routes
through the city and put the findings on a map.

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/shuttle-apple.ps The Apple shuttle reveals its destination "Main Campus Ridgeview">
</HTMLONLY>

The shuttles also offer cargo areas in their lower parts,
accessible via the side hatches, allowing for
luggage to be stored and brought along on the ride. Some hipsters
live quite far from the shuttle stop, ride their bikes there and then 
store them in the shuttle's belly when it arrives. On the bus, the
passengers enjoy free Wifi to hook up with the company network during the 
ride, to check email or get work done, just as if they were sitting at 
their desks at work.

Each shuttle-operating Silicon Valley company covers different neighborhoods.
Google offers the best coverage with an astounding 22
unmarked stops across town<HTMLONLY> (Figure (#1))</HTMLONLY>, 
provided by a half-dozen different bus routes. As soon as they reach the 
city limit, they proceed non-stop to Google's headquarters in Mountain View.

<pic images/shuttle-traffic.ps Just another day on the shuttle stuck in traffic on freeway 101 between San Francisco and Sunnyvale.>

Most of the company shuttles pick up employees at otherwise
rarely used public transit stops, frequented otherwise
by San Francisco's MUNI bus system. Occasionally, this gets
people confused, because if there's ten people waiting in line, it happens
that regular folks or sometimes even homeless people join in, only to 
realize later that those young computer nerds (easily to recognize by
shouldered backpacks and smart phone in hand) then start boarding
an unmarked private shuttle with destination unknown.

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/shuttle-google-map.ps (#1) Google offers the most shuttle routes, frequenting stops across the city.>
</HTMLONLY>

Every once in a while, a confused Googler lines up at the Yahoo stop, which 
is when they're politely directed to their stop around the corner. Employees
can be told apart by watching for tiny details: Yahoos are often carrying
backpacks of the "Targus" brand, with a small "Y!" label on it, and many of
them are wearing "Flickr" t-shirts. Googlers
carry their laptops in unmarked backpacks of the "Swiss Army" brand. Google
t-shirts seem to have gone out of fashion, hardly anyone is wearing 
them anymore. The shuttles themselves conceal their identiy as well, 
except for the
purple Yahoo bus which sports a big "Yahoo" banner on its back. All others
can be distinguished only by looking very closely for small marks, 
only known to insiders.

Here's a few insider tips: The Google shuttle is usually a black 
double decker bus with tinted windows, displaying "GBUS MTV" on an LED
screen in one of the lower side windows to indicate that it's destined
to Google Headquarters in Mountain View, at the "Shoreline Boulevard"
exit. Facebook is running a big single decker bus, coyly displaying 
"MPK" on the side top to hint on the fact that it goes to the Facebook
campus in Menlo Park. The Apple shuttle displays "Main Campus Ridgeview",
and Apple employees know that the bus will stop at the main
Apple campus in Cupertino, as well as the smaller campus at 
Ridgeview Court.

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/shuttle-sf-map.ps On sfist.com someone drew a map with all secret shuttle routes.>
</HTMLONLY>

It's not very common that riders talk to each other at the stop, if you're
working for a company with more than 10,000 employees, that's like a small 
city, and you wouldn't strike up a conversation with random 
people either. Until recently, one of the Yahoo stops was located right
across the street from a gathering point for South American esquineros
(day laborers, see <RBLINK>20090529#2</RBLINK>), who are dressed up 
in hoodies and waiting for the next pickup truck to take them to a nearby
construction site to make a few dollars off the record. They must have
wondered what was going on across the street, where a line of 
backback-wearing hipsters kept growing by a person a minute, each of them
silently typing away on their smartphones.

Dieses PhÃ¤nomen des eigentlich vÃ¶llig unamerikanischen Sozialneids ist nicht
neu in San Francisco. WÃ¤hrend es im New York der 80er-Jahre vÃ¶llig normal war,
dass die Stretch-Limos der Superreichen (heutzutage fahren nur noch Touristen in
Strech-Limos, wie die Zeiten sich Ã¤ndern) an Bettlern am StraÃenrand
vorbeipreschten, gab es schon anno 1996, als euer werter ErzÃ¤hler in San
Francisco aufschlug, Randalierer, die in Gegenden wie dem damaligen
mexikanischen Arbeiterviertel Mission teure Autos mit SchlÃ¼sseln verkratzten.
Interessanterweise machten damals wie heute kaum ethnische Minderheiten Rabatz,
sondern junge weiÃe KapitalverschmÃ¤her, die sich als Milchschaumerzeuger in
trendigen KaffeehÃ¤usern durchschleppen und vielleicht fÃ¼nf Jahre lÃ¤nger im

@Z: Wieder Warten auf den Regen

<pic images/tap-water.ps KÃ¶nnte wegen Regenmangel bald knapp werden: Leitungswasser Foto: flickr[Joe Cheng|jcheng/11438637]>

<em>Angelika</em>
Michael gibt immer gern damit an, dass es in San Francisco in der Regel
zwischen April und September nicht regnet. Was stimmt. Problematisch ist
nur, wenn der Regen dann auch zwischen Oktober und MÃ¤rz ausbleibt,
besonders wenn dies mehrere Jahre in Folge immer wieder passiert. Wenn euch
das als aufmerksamer 
Rundbriefleser jetzt vielleicht bekannt vorkommt, dann habt ihr ein
gutes GedÃ¤chtnis, denn 2009 hatten wir schon einmal eine Ã¤hnliche
Situation (<RBLINK>20090315#10</RBLINK>).

Damals rief Arnold
Schwarzenegger als Gouverneur den Notstand aus, dieses Mal tat es Jerry
Brown im Januar. ZunÃ¤chst geht es um freiwillige Einsparungen. 20% sind das
Ziel, und die BevÃ¶lkerung nimmt es sich tatsÃ¤chlich zu Herzen und spart
freiwillig Wasser ein. Es ist Ã¼brigens erst das dritte Mal seit 1987, dass
der Notstand in Kalifornien wegen anhaltender Trockenheit ausgerufen wird,
aber dieses Mal merken wir selbst in San Francisco, dass die Lage ernst ist.

Im Januar hatten wir eine derart schlechte Luft, dass wir uns vorkamen wie 
in Los Angeles. Normalerweise weht immer ein
LÃ¼ftchen in San Francisco und schon der Nebel macht es oft angenehm feucht,
aber im Januar war es tageweise so warm und windstill, dass die
LuftqualitÃ¤t gehÃ¶rig litt und der Smog Ã¼ber der Bucht hing. Die
Schigebiete in Tahoe guckten ebenfalls in die RÃ¶hre, denn es will einfach
nicht schneien und im Dezember brannte es am Big Sur am Highway One. 
VÃ¶llig irre, denn in der Gegend kommt man sich in der Regel eher wie im 
Regenwald vor.

Bauern in sÃ¼dlicheren Gefilden Kaliforniens trennen sich schon von Teilen
ihrer Rinderherden, denn das Gras wird nicht grÃ¼n durch die
Trockenheit und viele kÃ¶nnen es sich nicht leisten, teures Futter oder Heu zu
kaufen. SchÃ¤tzungen besagen, dass durch die DÃ¼rre bedingt, allein 800
bis 1200 Quadratkilometer landwirtschaftliche FlÃ¤chen im Fresno County brach
liegen werden dieses Jahr. Die Landwirtschaft benutzt Ã¼brigens 80% des
Wassers des kalifornischen Bundesstaates.

Letzte Woche trÃ¶pfelte es dann tatsÃ¤chlich etwas und auch am Wochenende
regnete es und jeder freute sich, setzte dann aber gleich besorgt hinzu,
dass das lÃ¤ngst noch nicht reicht und es dringend mehr regnen mÃ¼sste. Der
fehlende Regen ist wirklich Dauerthema, ob man sich einen Kaffee bei
"Martha" um die Ecke holt oder in der Schlange im Supermarkt ansteht.

@Z: Topp-App: Waze

<pic images/waze-dash.ps Auf dem Armaturenbrett montiert warnt das iPhone mit der Waze-App vor Blitzampeln und anderen Gefahren.>

<em>Michael</em>
Ich habe kÃ¼rzlich die App "Waze" auf meinem Smartphone installiert
und bin begeistert. "Waze" (ausgesprochen wie "Ways") ist eine Art
Navi mit sozialer Komponente. Sie weiÃ nicht nur den Weg von A nach B,
sondern kriegt auch mit, wo sich Staus bilden und findet neue Routen,
wenn sich mit Umwegen Zeit sparen lÃ¤sst. Dazu sendet die App stÃ¤ndig die
Geschwindigkeit des fahrenden Autos an den Waze-Server, aber auch der
Fahrer kann mithelfen: Sieht er einen Unfall oder liegt irgendein Trumm
auf der StraÃe, drÃ¼ckt er ein paar Tasten, und
andere Wazer auf der gleichen Strecke kriegen die Meldung auf den Schirm.
Der meldende Wazer bekommt dafÃ¼r Bonuspunkte.

Auf der Karte sieht der Fahrer, wie sein Fahrzeug sich durch die Gegend bewegt, 
und kleine Pacman-Ã¤hnliche Symbole zeigen, wo andere Wazer in der
Umgebung fahren.
Ãber Facebook weiÃ die App auÃerdem, ob Freunde des Fahrers auf der
gleichen Strecke unterwegs sind und teilt es diesem mit.

<pic images/waze.ps Der Autofahrer sieht auf der Waze-App, wo die Polizei steht und wo andere Wazer herumkurven.>

Steht am StraÃenrand ein Polizeiauto, um Raser zu blitzen, drÃ¼ckt der
aufmerksame Fahrer einen entsprechenden MenÃ¼punkt am 
Telefon und nachfolgende Wazer kriegen ein Polizistensymbol
auf ihre Karte. Schlagartig drosseln sie
ihre Geschwindigkeit auf die vorgeschriebenen 65 Meilen pro Stunde.
Stimmt eine Meldung nicht oder ist der Polizist schon wieder weg, weil
er ein Opfer geschnappt hat, drÃ¼ckt der pflichtbewusste Wazer das
"Not There"-KnÃ¶pferl und wenn mehrere das Gleiche tun wird Waze 
die Meldung irgendwann lÃ¶schen.
Man sollte es kaum glauben, aber diese DauerbeschÃ¤ftigung bringt Spannung
in selbst die langweiligsten Pendlerfahrten zur ArbeitsstÃ¤tte.
Ich hÃ¶re mittlerweile gar keine HÃ¶rbÃ¼cher mehr wenn ich einmal pro Woche
mit dem Auto zur Arbeit fahre, sondern melde einfach jedes gestrandete 
Fahrzeug am Wegesrand und versuche neugierig jeden gemeldeten Blitzer
zu erspÃ¤hen.

Waze wurde 2013 von Google gekauft und die von den Teilnehmern
beigetragenen Verkehrsdaten flieÃen mittlerweile in Google Maps ein.
