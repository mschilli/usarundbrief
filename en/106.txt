@Z: Cooking crab in Jordan's Kitchen

<pic images/crab-duo.ps Two five-star cooks on the quest for the Michelin star.>

<em>Angelika</em>
It's really not easy to find a present for Michael, as he has the bad
habit of buying everything himself, especially as short a week before his
birthday or Christmas.

He's reading books, but exclusively as e-books, and instead of listening
to CDs, he prefers streaming services like "Spotify" or "Rhapsody". That
makes finding presents for him extremely difficult, and I've been 
surprising him with joint adventures instead.

<pic images/crab-pull.ps Angelika takes a live Dungeness crab from the box.>

Because Michael likes to cook and I once enjoyed taking cooking classes a long
long time ago, my gift to him this year was a cooking class for the both of 
us. After researching quite a bit, I found 
<LINK>http://jordanskitchensf.com|"Jordan's Kitchen"</LINK> just around
the corner from us in the Mission neighborhood. Jordan, a famous chef, 
offers four hour classes teaching how to prepare a four course meal.
Since Michael and I love
<LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeness_crab|"Dungeness Crab"</LINK>,
and we've always wanted to know how to cook them starting from scratch, so I
signed up for the "Crab Cookout".

<pic images/crab-pot.ps The Dungeness Crab are cooking for about 12 minutes in boiling water until they're ready to be served.>

Dungeness Crab are native to the San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean
close to the U.S. west coast, harvesting 
season is typically between November and June. 
They are truly gargantuan in size, the massive body harness measures between six
and eight inches in diameter and the whole crab 
weighs about 2 pounds. Our cooking class
happened at the end of January, there were fourteen students and chef Jordan
told us everything there is to know about cooking crab. We had such a great
time! At first I had some doubts whether I would dare to grab a living
crab and place it in boiling water, but we learned that you need to snatch
the crab from behind so that it can't get your fingers with its claws and 
bravely I gave in to group pressure.

<pic images/crab-ice.ps After cooking the crab are placed in ice water.>

Interestingly enough, the clawed creatures first seemed quite apathic,
but started fidgeting as soon as we picked them up. When quickly 
submerged in boiling water, they stopped immediately, thankfully.
We were sipping some wine during the class, and the participants were
all pretty relaxed. Jordan also demonstrated how to take out the 
inedible parts of the cooked crab. We removed the upper plate, and took
out intestines like the lungs. There's some meat in the crab body as well,
which can be pulled out after cutting the carcass in quarters, but the main
source are the crab's claws and its eight feet, 
and getting to the delicious meat inside requires cracking their hard 
outer shells first.

<pic images/crab-legs.ps Now the Dungeness Crab needs to be cleaned and dismantled.>

Here's the list of the four courses we cooked: 
Dungeness crab meat in coconut milk on cucumber slices; 
Bucatini pasta with crab meat; roasted crab in orange and garlic butter;
apple and pear compote with cornflower croutons. What was nice was
that all participants cooked and later ate as one big team. And I 
received a personal training from Jordan on how to use a chef's knife!
Highly recommended class!

@Z: Montreal, Canada

<pic images/montreal-arret.ps They speak French in Montreal.>

<em>Michael</em>
In December this year, we traveled to Canada. This time, we set out 
to explore the French-speaking part on the east coast and first had 
a stop-over after a five hour flight in Toronto. According to several
previous experiences, Canadian immigration personnel are about the 
unfriendliest people on earth, and living up to our expectations, 
the person behind the counter greeted us this time by balking
"What do you want in Canada?!" at us. Luckily, we know how to deal with 
this kind of situation. But, really, Canada?

When we asked our cab driver on the way from the airport to downtown 
Montreal if he spoke English, and we of course asked in French,
he laughingly exclaimed: "No!" and we set out to explain that we only 
spoke very little French. The rest of the ride resumed in silence. I 
still remembered French numbers from school way back when pretty well, 
so I could at least tell him how much I was willing to pay for the ride
including tip as we safely arrived.

<pic images/montreal-mural-red.ps Montreal is a colorful city.>
<pic images/montreal-2nd-floor-stairs.ps Typical Montreal: Small houses with a separate entrance for the 2nd floor.>

We were truly shocked that except for a few American tourists everyone
speaks French in Montreal. Every store you enter, the first thing
you hear is "Bonjour!" and if you don't clue people in, they start 
throwing French at you at a speed that is really hard to understand
for non-native speakers. For what it's worth, I have spent a solid 
five years of my life learning French, in a high school in Germany from 7th to 
11th grade, four hours a week. Admittedly, French in school never resonated 
with me and I ended up with barely passing grades, but this illustrates
fairly well that there's certain areas where the German education system 
went right by me without much effect.

<pic images/montreal-house-comic.ps At outside temperatures of -1C (30F) the colorful houses of Montreal sure look nice in the sunshine.>

But if the visitor then carefully inquires if their vis-à-vis might 
perhaps speak English ("Parlez-vous Anglais?"), it turns out that every 
native under 30 does so fluently. We found out that apparently
French-Canadians get upset when visitors automatically assume that everyone 
speaks English. It seems a bit strange, but, hey, when in Rome.

Another oddity are the store opening hours, which are rather European than
American. For example, we went to this grocery store right 
by the train station,
and knowing they might be closing early on a Saturday, we inquired about 
how long they were open, and learned while gnashing our teeth that they 
would close at 5pm. To make sure we still would be able to get our groceries
for the weekend, we showed up at 4:15pm and saw to our surprise that the 
meat counter was virtually sold out and the cheese fridge had already be
covered up with protective tarp. Luckily, we had been there the day before,
knew where everything was located, and were able to direct a sales person 
to the sealed-off areas in order to get a few items for our evening meal.

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/montreal-house.ps Colorfully painted old house in a Montreal side street.>
</HTMLONLY>

In one store, we inquired if there was a bakery nearby. All the clerks stuck 
their heads together, and started a lively discussion in French. After
some back and forth, from what we understood there were several shopping 
malls that were evaluated, they concluded that it was 
too complicated to explain, and no, they were sorry, but they couldn't 
tell us where the next bakery was. Wha-what? 
We found this quite strange, because,
I mean, if someone asked us in downtown San Francisco where the next 
bakery was, most likely we'd be scratching our heads a bit because 
high rents typically drive bakeries to the outskirts, but we would
certainly be able to give directions on how to get to the nearest location.

<pic images/cornichons.ps Take as many pickles from the jar as you want, and then return it.>

And having lived for decades in the United States, we noticed a few 
stunning small differences in the French part of Canada: Sales clerks 
handling food aren't wearing gloves like back in the States. When we dined
at a really good French bistro in Montreal one day, the waiter placed a 
gigantic jar with pickles on our table, and we extracted as many gherkins as we
liked by using a pair of big wooden tongs provided for this purpose.
When we were done, the waiter took the jar away, only to set it down
at a different party's table! This would never fly in the U.S., the health
department would start issuing violations and patrons would freak out!
As born Europeans, we liked it, of course.

In the excellent "Beaver Hall" restaurant, named after the street it
is located on, the waiter placed a whole loaf of bread on our table after
we ordered, and put a gigantic bread knife with a serrated blade next to it.
Imagine that to happen in the U.S., the restaurant owner would certainly
worry about clumsy or reckless guests injuring themselves and having to
deal with the resulting liability issues and million-dollar lawsuits!

Across the board, dining in the French part of Canada is a truly eye-opening
experience, the food was truly excellent whereever we went. 
It's not exactly cheap but well worth the money, and the patrons are 
dressed up much fancier than in the U.S., although you can only tell after 
they've taken off their puffball-sized down jackets, which the waiters
quickly put away to place them in the coat check area.

<pic images/montreal-macrons.ps Expensive cookies with filling, called "macrons".>

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/montreal-macrons-box.ps All macrons have to fit exactly into the box.>
</HTMLONLY>

Another French specialty are the so-called "Macrons". Those two-layered 
cookies feature fillings of all kinds of flavors, and they're packed into
small 
cardboard boxes by the dozen. Allegedly, they're really complicated to make,
which is why, so the rumor goes, one cookie the size of a postage stamp 
costs more than a dollar. They're not bad, but I'd hardly drive all the way 
up to Canada to taste them. The sales person packs exactly one dozen 
into a small rectangular box, and if they don't fit all in, 
they're being squeezed until they do. 

<pic images/montreal-notre-dames-bon-secour.ps Over night, Montreal was suddenly covered in snow. This is a tiny church in Montreal's Old Town named Notre Dames Bon Secour.>

After three cold, but sunny days (always around 32F), all of a sudden, one
morning, there were four inches of snow on the ground. We had done our homework
and brought our Alaska gear to Montreal, so we just bundled up and grudgingly
trudged through the slushy snow on the sidewalks. Interestingly, traffic was
largely unimpacted.

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/montreal-saq-opening-hours.ps The government-controlled liquor store has inconvenient opening hours and closes at 5pm on Sundays!>
</HTMLONLY>

When it comes to retailing alcoholic beverages, Canada features some of
the most absurd regulations known to man. Details vary from state to state, 
so for example in the city of Montreal, 
located in the state of Quebec, supermarkets
are legally allowed to sell wine and beer, but no hard liquor. A 
government-controlled store chain named "SAQ" (<LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_des_alcools_du_Qu%C3%A9bec|Société des alcools du Québec</LINK>), on the other hand, offers wine, beer, and hard liquor in a 
somewhat elevated price category. Their store hours aren't exactly 
customer friendly, though, for example, they're closing at 5pm on Sundays!

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/montreal-apportez-votre-vin.ps "Apportez votre vin": You can bring your own wine to this restaurant.>
</HTMLONLY>

Restaurants often have a liquor license, but many don't, and by displaying
a "Apportez votre vin" sigh, they're inviting customers to bring their own 
wine, usually purchased from a nearby store. Unlike in the U.S., they
usually don't charge a "corking fee". It's a very good deal, as wines
that cost $10 retail a bottle are often listed for $50 on the wine
menu.

<pic images/montreal-foie-gras.ps (#2) In Montreal with its French influence, of course you can get foie gras.>

As you might know, selling foie gras in California has been outlawed about
a year ago (<RBLINK>20121103#10</RBLINK>). Other states, for example
Nevada, still offer it, and, as you've probably guessed, it's a staple on the
menus in many French Canadian restaurants. Whenever the government takes
something away, the natural reaction is to crave it, and when we saw
that $25 can of foie gras on a christmas market in Montreal, we had to get
it. Applied as spread on cruncy European-style bread sold at the
"Premier Moisson" bakerey which, against all odds, we managed to find
anyway, it tasted fabulous.

<pic images/montreal-jump.ps Even at frosty temperatures, Michael has to goof off.>

@Z: Quebec, Canada

<em>Michael</em>
Four days later, we hauled our rolling luggage on partially de-iced sidewalks 
to the train station "Gare Central", located about half a mile from our hotel.
We were heading to Quebec, about 160 miles north-east of Montreal. The city
of Quebec is referred to by "Quebec City" by Canadians to avoid confusion as
both Montreal and Quebec City are located in the Canadian state of Quebec.
Bulky luggage wasn't permitted in the train vestibules, so we dropped
ours off at the baggage check, just like at the airport. There wasn't any
annoying rigamarole like having to show ID or being chased through a body
scanner. Since we had our passports in hand, the baggage handler even 
jokingly snatched them and hid them behind his back! Most travelers boarded
the train 30 minutes before departure. The train wasn't going very fast,
only about 60 miles per hour, but offered a stable and
pretty speedy Wifi connection.

<pic images/quebec-train-baggage.ps In Quebec we received our bags at the luggage car located at the head of the train.>

As soon as we got off the train in Quebec, we noticed that the 
outside temperature had gone down from "frosty" to "brutally cold". 
During our stay, we experienced cold snaps with temperatures 
as low as -14F (-26C), and if you're outside on such a day and the
cold wind is blowing in your face, this gets old pretty quickly.

<pic images/quebec-castle-ice-river.ps The city wall and the old castle hotel in Quebec.>

Quebec is an astonishingly old city, at least it seems so when you're visiting
from the United States. Its history dates back to the 17th century, and its old
town at the top of the hill is called "Haute-Ville", connected
to the lower part "Basse-Ville" by both an ancient elevator and a regular
road.

<pic images/quebec-angelika-cannons.ps Angelika is freezing next to old cannons in Quebec.>

There's many ancient cannons standing around everywhere throughout the city 
and all kinds of old masonry for the curious visitor to inspect. 
From what we've heard, during the summer months, Quebec turns into a 
possibly hard to bear tourist location, with all kinds of buzzling
festivals and packed stores and restaurants. During the winter months, however,
it is charminging bleary, and the few restaurants still open bid a warm 
welcome to visitors, and will happily walk them through the entire menu
in English if that is what it takes.

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/quebec-billboard.ps The sunlight comes in horizontally, and in combination with the cold clear air provides excellent conditions for photographers.>
</HTMLONLY>

It's a photographer's paradise. The sun usually hangs low on the horizon,
casting an almost horizontal light, which creates a grandiose ambience.
The air is crystal clear, due to the extreme cold, and the only hard
part is hitting the release without taking off the mittens! Hitting the
button on a pedestrian crossing light while wearing mittens poses the
same problem, but Quebec solved this one by placing sensors next to the 
buttons and all you need to do to trigger the signal is to hold your
mitten next to it (Figure (#4)).

<pic images/quebec-glove-switch.ps (#4) Pedestrian crossings feature these proximity sensors that trigger the light when an object like a mitten-protected hand gets near it.>

We found Canada's French-speaking part way more interesting than its
western parts, which are mainly a pretty lame version of similar 
American cities. Vancouver or Toronto are not more than a poor man's 
San Francisco, and can be safely skipped, but travelers exploring Canada's 
east side will find a truly unique culture. We got a refresher in speaking
French and ate a lot of excellent food. In Montreal, for example, I had
a Filet Mignon so undescribably tender that I can't name a place which 
serves anything even remotely comparable. Beware, though, 
that French Canadians use a lot of butter in their cuisine, which can
make you feel a bit bloated after a while. People are very friendly there, just
don't forget to always start a conversation in French, even if it's just
asking for a table for two in a restaurant. After the initial ice breaker, you
can safely switch to English.

@Z: The Tech Bus

<pic images/shuttle-yahoo.ps The Yahoo shuttle clearly states which company is running it.>

<em>Michael</em>
In the beginning, there was only the Google bus. Dating back to
2008 (<RBLINK>20080502#5</RBLINK>), the Internet giant has been picking up 
employees all over San Francisco and is driving them down to Silicon
Valley every day. And even back then, upset neighbors complained about the dark
heavy luxury buses, roaming through small residential streets in the
early morning hours, some of them letting their engines idle for ten 
minutes while waiting. The gossip site <LINK>http://allthingsd.com/20130721/san-francisco-may-crack-down-on-corporate-shuttle-buses|Allthingsd ran the story "San Francisco May Crack Down on Corporate Shuttle Buses"</LINK> back then and
rumored the San Francisco might soon be imposing new regulation for the tech
buses.

<pic images/shuttle-gbus.ps With "GBUS MTV" on the display, the Google shuttle indicates somewhat cryptically that it's destined for the Google campus in Mountain View.>

Nowadays, every big Silicon Valley company offers shuttles as a perk, because
they're all aware that tech workers who are forced to commute during rush hour
between 7:30 and 9:00 in the morning on the chronically clogged freeways 101
and 280, will sooner or later either go bananas or look for different
employment opportunities directly in the city. Today, I'll let you in on which
company is running which bus, as most of them are unmarked and only employees
know their shuttles and where they're headed.  Actually, on
<LINK>http://sfist.com/2012/09/25/behold_the_secret_corporate_shuttle.php|sfist.com</LINK>
someone went through the exercise of following the shuttles on their routes
through the city and put the findings on a map.

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/shuttle-apple.ps The Apple shuttle reveals its destination "Main Campus Ridgeview">
</HTMLONLY>

The shuttles also offer cargo areas in their lower parts,
accessible via the side hatches, allowing for
luggage to be stored and brought along on the ride. Some hipsters
live quite far from the shuttle stop, ride their bikes there and then 
store them in the shuttle's belly when it arrives. On the bus, the
passengers enjoy free Wifi to hook up with the company network during the 
ride, to check email or get work done, just as if they were sitting at 
their desks at work.

Each shuttle-operating Silicon Valley company covers different neighborhoods.
Google offers the best coverage with an astounding 22
unmarked stops across town<HTMLONLY> (Figure (#1))</HTMLONLY>, 
provided by a half-dozen different bus routes. As soon as they reach the 
city limit, they proceed non-stop to Google's headquarters in Mountain View.

<pic images/shuttle-traffic.ps Just another day on the shuttle stuck in traffic on freeway 101 between San Francisco and Sunnyvale.>

Most of the company shuttles pick up employees at otherwise
rarely used public transit stops, frequented otherwise
by San Francisco's MUNI bus system. Occasionally, this gets
people confused, because if there's ten people waiting in line, it happens
that regular folks or sometimes even homeless people join in, only to 
realize later that those young computer nerds (easily to recognize by
shouldered backpacks and smart phone in hand) then start boarding
an unmarked private shuttle with destination unknown.

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/shuttle-google-map.ps (#1) Google offers the most shuttle routes, frequenting stops across the city.>
</HTMLONLY>

Every once in a while, a confused Googler lines up at the Yahoo stop, which 
is when they're politely directed to their stop around the corner. Employees
can be told apart by watching for tiny details: Yahoos are often carrying
backpacks of the "Targus" brand, with a small "Y!" label on it, and many of
them are wearing "Flickr" t-shirts. Googlers
carry their laptops in unmarked backpacks of the "Swiss Army" brand. Google
t-shirts seem to have gone out of fashion, hardly anyone is wearing 
them anymore. The shuttles themselves conceal their identiy as well, 
except for the
purple Yahoo bus which sports a big "Yahoo" banner on its back. All others
can be distinguished only by looking very closely for small marks, 
only known to insiders.

Here's a few insider tips: The Google shuttle is usually a black 
double decker bus with tinted windows, displaying "GBUS MTV" on an LED
screen in one of the lower side windows to indicate that it's destined
to Google Headquarters in Mountain View, at the "Shoreline Boulevard"
exit. Facebook is running a big single decker bus, coyly displaying 
"MPK" on the side top to hint on the fact that it goes to the Facebook
campus in Menlo Park. The Apple shuttle displays "Main Campus Ridgeview",
and Apple employees know that the bus will stop at the main
Apple campus in Cupertino, as well as the smaller campus at 
Ridgeview Court.

<HTMLONLY>
<pic images/shuttle-sf-map.ps On sfist.com someone drew a map with all secret shuttle routes.>
</HTMLONLY>

It's not very common that riders talk to each other at the stop, if you're
working for a company with more than 10,000 employees, that's like a small 
city, and you wouldn't strike up a conversation with random 
people either. Until recently, one of the Yahoo stops was located right
across the street from a gathering point for South American esquineros
(day laborers, see <RBLINK>20090529#2</RBLINK>), who are dressed up 
in hoodies and waiting for the next pickup truck to take them to a nearby
construction site to make a few dollars off the record. They must have
wondered what was going on across the street, where a line of 
backback-wearing hipsters kept growing by a person a minute, each of them
silently typing away on their smartphones.

<pic images/shuttle-protesters.ps Protesters block the Apple shuttle.>

Recently,
<LINK>http://blog.sfgate.com/stew/2013/12/09/protesters-block-google-bus-in-s-f-mission|a few upset hooligans even blocked a fully occupied Google bus</LINK>
and prevented it from leaving the stop. The protesters voiced their
concerns about on private
companies using the public bus stops without paying for the privilege. 
The city of San Francisco promptly reacted and 
now plans to charge them 1 Dollar per stop per bus, 
which will flush the city coffers with about 1.5 million dollars ... at least
in theory, but city officials have admitted that this will only cover the 
costs of collecting and enforcing the payments, so in the end, there's no
profit. Hard to explain why they're doing it anyway.

The funniest part was a 
<LINK>http://blog.sfgate.com/chronstyle/2013/12/09/what-do-you-wear-to-look-like-a-google-employee|hooligan dressed up as a Google employee</LINK> (you guessed it: shouldering a backpack), who pretended to be upset and yelled at the protesters. He was part of the show.

Although the phenomenon of social envy isn't very common in the U.S., it's 
more prominent in San Francisco than in other places. Compare this to, say,
New York City in the 80ies, where it was considered normal that stretch
limos chauffering the super rich dashed by peddlers on the sidewalk 
(today, only tourists ride in stretch limos, how the times are changing),
whereas in San Francisco in 1996, when your humble narrator entered
the scene, there were already disgruntled locals combing through the 
former Mexican working class Mission district
at night, applying scratches on the paint of expensive-looking parked cars.
Interestingly, then and now those hooligans weren't ethnic
minorities but disgruntled white anti-capitalists working as milk foamers
in trendy coffee shops, who have been living there maybe five years
longer than Googlers they all hate. What a bunch of idiots!

Across the Bay, in the traditionally more rustic city of Oakland, the
protesters displayed a "Fuck Off Google" banner and an apparently deranged
person shattered a side window of the bus by throwing a rock at it. I wonder if
there's soon going to be live TV broadcasts featuring software geeks roughing
up vandals to get to work?  In any case, it's a hot topic right now and various
opinions are floating around, fueled by droves of flourishing

@Z: Waiting For the Rain Again

<pic images/tap-water.ps Because of the drought, we're being asked to save tap water  Foto: flickr[Joe Cheng|jcheng/11438637]>

<em>Angelika</em>
Michael has been known to brag about
that there's usually not a drop of rain between the months of April and
September in San Francisco, which is actually true. But if then there's
hardly any rain between October and March as well, that's a problem,
especially if this condition reoccurs for a few years in a row. 
And if you remember that we've had a similar situation
in 2009 (<RBLINK>20090315#10</RBLINK>), then you are an astute reader
with commendable memory.

Back then, it was governor Arnold Schwarzenegger who declared a state of
emergency because of the drought, this time it was Jerry Brown's turn in
January. The most important thing right now is saving water voluntarily simply
by using less. The goal is a 20% reduction of water use, and Californians are
really taking it seriously. For the record, this is the 3rd time since 1987,
that there's a declared state of emergency because of a prolonged drought in
California, and this time, the message arrived loud and clearly in
even in San Francisco.

In January, the air quality over San Francisco was unusally bad, we were
reminded of how it's like in Los Angeles! On a normal day, there's
always a light breeze over San Francisco, with some fog providing
pleasant humidity, but a few days in January were really warm and calm,
which badly impacted the air quality and some smog appeared over the Bay.
Ski resorts near Lake Tahoe also had a hard time for lack of snow, and
a big wildfire was blazing near Big Sur at Highway One. Crazy, I know,
because ususally around that time of year it rather feels like 
a rain forest in this area.

Some Farmers in the southern parts of California had to sell some of 
their live stock, because the grass won't turn green in these dry conditions
and many can't afford to buy expensive feed or hay. According to estimates,
because of the drought, about 300 to 450 square miles of farmland in Fresno 
county can't be used at all this year. Farming requires about 80% of 
California's water every year.

Last week, finally, we received a few drops of rain, and people were quite
relieved, but quickly added that it was nowhere near enough and we need a lot
more in the coming months. The lack of rain is really an ongoing discussion,
and people are talking about it everywhere, be it around the corner at Martha's
coffee shop or while lining up at the supermarket register.

@Z: Top App: Waze

<pic images/waze-dash.ps Mounted on the dashboard, the iPhone running the Waze app triggers alerts when traffic light cameras and other hazards are approaching.>

<em>Michael</em>

Recently, I installed the "Waze" app on my smartphone and was blown away.
"Waze" (pronounced like "ways") is some kind of navigation software with
a social touch. Not only can it navigate you from A to B, but also knows
about traffic jams and finds new routes if detours get you to your
destination faster.
For this to happen, the app keeps sending your current location to the 
Waze server, but the driver can manually help as well: If there's an 
accident or a hazard like an item on the road, the driver presses a few
buttons to report it and other wazers in the vicinity get a message onto
the screen to alert them. The reporting wazer gets bonus points in return.

The driver can watch on the interactive map where the vehicle is currently
located, and tiny Pacman-like symbols indicate where other Wazers
are driving on streets nearby. By linking to Facebook, the app knows if
any of the driver's friends are driving close by, and announces them.

<pic images/waze.ps When running the Waze app, the driver gets the latest police sightings and can see the location of other Wazers on the road.>

TODO

Steht am Straßenrand ein Polizeiauto, um Raser zu blitzen, drückt der
aufmerksame Fahrer einen entsprechenden Menüpunkt am 
Telefon und nachfolgende Wazer kriegen ein Polizistensymbol
auf ihre Karte. Schlagartig drosseln sie
ihre Geschwindigkeit auf die vorgeschriebenen 65 Meilen pro Stunde.
Stimmt eine Meldung nicht oder ist der Polizist schon wieder weg, weil
er ein Opfer geschnappt hat, drückt der pflichtbewusste Wazer das
"Not There"-Knöpferl und wenn mehrere das Gleiche tun wird Waze 
die Meldung irgendwann löschen.
Man sollte es kaum glauben, aber diese Dauerbeschäftigung bringt Spannung
in selbst die langweiligsten Pendlerfahrten zur Arbeitsstätte.
Ich höre mittlerweile gar keine Hörbücher mehr wenn ich einmal pro Woche
mit dem Auto zur Arbeit fahre, sondern melde einfach jedes gestrandete 
Fahrzeug am Wegesrand und versuche neugierig jeden gemeldeten Blitzer
zu erspähen.

Waze wurde 2013 von Google gekauft und die von den Teilnehmern
beigetragenen Verkehrsdaten fließen mittlerweile in Google Maps ein.
Hoffentlich lässt das Google die sympatische App leben.
