@Z: Devastating fires in Malibu

<pic images/corral-canyon-pano.ps On a hiking trail through a previously burned area.>

<em>Michael</em> 
Surely you have heard in the news about the devastating wildfires in
Los Angeles in January. What you might not know is that we were on
vacation there just three days before. We had rented a place in
Venice Beach over New Year's and were doing our typical L.A.
activities, like dining out, biking along the beach to Santa Monica,
and I got to surf. After the waves at Manhattan Beach were too high
for me one day, we drove up to just before Malibu to Will Rogers
Park, and I paddled out at the pier and caught a few waves. We had no
idea that just three days later, the entire area, including my surf
beach, would burn down!

<pic images/will-rogers-surf.ps Surfer Michael in the waves in front of Will Rogers Park.>

And, a few days earlier, on an extremely sunny, almost hot day (in
January), we had set out on a hiking trail that led up into the hills
through Corral Canyon near Malibu. We marveled at the area, which
consisted only of burnt bushes, as a wildfire had raged there several
months before.

<pic images/corral-canyon-plant.ps After the last forest fire, fire retardant tainted this plant.>

The red fire retardant that the fire department had
sprayed over the area with airplanes to control the flames was still
sticking to the withered and scorched plants along the trail. It was an eerie
scenario, and we said to ourselves, "No wonder a fire spreads
explosively here; those dried-out bushes burn like tinder!" And we had
no idea that three days later, just a few hills away, it would
actually catch fire, and catastrophically so!

<pic images/corral-canyon-a.ps Hiking trail on a straw-dry hill in Corral Canyon.>

This time, the wildfires destroyed entire towns, like Palisades and
vast residential areas along the coast. Even the beach houses along
the Pacific Coast Highway now lie in ruins. Wildfires in California are
notoriously not uncommon, but the reason it turned into a century
catastrophe this time, leaving tens of thousands homeless and
transforming the area into a lunar landscape for decades, is the
misguided policies of the county. For decades, forestry management
was neglected, and funding for the local fire department was cut.
Now, tens of thousands of affected people are left uprooted without
homes and will have to deal with insurance and insane bureaucratic
requirements for rebuilding for years, before they can live there
again.

<pic images/corral-canyon-coast.ps The affected area is located directly by the ocean.>

We are certainly glad that we escaped unscathed ahead of time. As part of the
sudden evacuation measures, the Pacific Coast Highway, where we were already
stuck in traffic during normal times, turned into a death trap, and many people
simply abandoned their cars and fled on foot. Television news later reported
how bulldozers had pushed the abandoned vehicles off the highway to make room.
That would have been a mess for us, my dear!

@Z: National Egg Shortage

<pic images/eggs-tj-afternoon.ps All eggs sold out.>

<em>Angelika</em> In March, I had my birthday. As is well known, birthdays come
with cake. However, since eggs are currently in short supply in the USA, we
actually had to ration our eggs before my birthday. We skipped our weekend
breakfast eggs so that there would be enough left for baking the cake. In the
supermarkets here, customers are currently allowed to buy only a certain number
of egg cartons. At "Trader Joe's," for example, that's only one carton with 12
eggs per customer per day. However, if customers don't show up first thing in
the morning, all they find is empty egg shelves.

<pic images/eggs-go.ps Pretty steep: More than 10 dollars for a dozen eggs.>

It goes without saying that due to the scarcity, the prices for eggs
are rising. We already learned this in school about the market
economy: The good is scarce, but the demand is high, so the price
goes up. In San Francisco, the average price for a dozen eggs is
currently a hefty $9. "Trader Joe's" is one of the few supermarket
chains that hasn't raised their egg prices exorbitantly yet. There,
customers can still get a carton of eggs for $5. However, because of
this, the shelves are always particularly quickly emptied. Some
restaurants are already adding a surcharge to egg-heavy dishes, such as the
chains "Waffle House" and "Denny's."

<pic images/eggs-tj-morning.ps In the morning hours, the rush for the egg shelf begins.>

But why are eggs scarce here in the USA? An outbreak of avian flu is
the primary reason. Many chickens had to be culled because they
carried the virus. Fewer egg-laying chickens now unfortunately
produce fewer eggs for sale. Chicken farms in the USA are often quite
large, with up to a million chickens per farm. However, if avian flu
breaks out, usually all chickens have to be killed to prevent further
spread of the virus.

<pic images/eggs-fridge.ps Eggs of immeasurable value in the editorial office refrigerator>

The prices for eggs had already increased due to inflation before the
outbreak of avian flu, and new regulations in some states, such as
cage-free housing on chicken farms, have exacerbated the shortage. In
California, since 2022, egg-laying chickens on chicken farms can no
longer be kept in cages and must be given freedom of movement. These
rules also apply to egg producers outside of California if their
products are imported here. In fact, California voters had approved
Proposition 12, the "Farm Animal Confinement Initiative," in 2018
with 63% of the vote, which mandates humane treatment. It has been
implemented since 2022. Especially now during Easter, eggs are in the
spotlight. But what to do when eggs are scarce? I recently read in
the New York Times that some clever folks are switching to
alternatives, such as coloring potatoes instead of eggs. Well, to
each their own.

@Z: New speed traps in San Francisco

<pic images/speed-trap-sja.ps Getting caught speeding by this speed camera results in a fine.>

<em>Michael</em> 
Whenever I drive through Germany on vacation, I immediately switch to
Defcon One, because it's important to spot all those speed traps in time.
Often, an inconspicuous village in the middle of nowhere has
installed a stationary camera to cash in on us tourists, and cities
like Munich or Augsburg are practically plastered with speed cameras.
Not to mention the mobile units that set up speed traps in the most
unlikely places.

<pic images/radar-trap-camera-sja.ps The speed camera is tiny and hard to see.>

I never would have thought that such surveillance state methods would take hold
here in San Francisco. But our Governor Gavin Newsom signed
<LINK>https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB645|Assembly Bill No. 645|Governor Newsom Signs Red-Light Camera Bill</LINK> in 2023, which
layed the legal groundwork for the speed cameras. As is well known, the wheels
of our city administration turn at a snail’s pace, but by March 2025, all 33
cameras of the "pilot project" had been installed in San Francisco.  The mayor
and city council inaugurated them with great fanfare under the motto "Speed
Safety." So far, only a few of the cameras have been activated, and even those
are currently only sending warning notices without fines by mail to drivers.
The website of the responsible agency
<LINK>https://www.sfmta.com/projects/speed-safety-cameras|SFMTA shows the current status|Status of the speed cameras</LINK> of all 33 installed traps (Figure (#8)).
To prevent any caught driver from getting the idea to sue the city,
there are large signs a few feet before the cameras indicating the permitted maximum speed
and the note "Photo Enforced" (Illustration (#7)).

<pic images/trap-photo-enforced.ps (#7) A warning sign announces the speed trap.>

The whole setup, of course, has the catch that speeding criminals
with stolen cars won't ever pay any fines. And, typical for San Francisco,
a two-tier legal system applies: average earners are punished twice
as harshly as poor people, because speeding low-income earners
officially receive a 50% discount (Figure (#6)).

<pic images/radar-traps-sf-fines.ps (#6) Those with low income are allowed to speed at half price.>

From the table in Figure (#6), you can see that the grading was
obviously determined by someone who has never driven a car
before. The fine for a kamikaze speeder who races through the
city at over 100 mph (160 km/h) is only $500, or just $250 for those
with low income! As mentioned, no fines have been issued yet.

According to a study by the city's transportation authority SFMTA
(San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency),
<LINK>https://sfstandard.com/2025/02/19/the-new-automated-speed-cameras-need-humans-to-check-their-work/|42,210 drivers per day|Study on Speed Cameras</LINK>
exceeded the permitted maximum speed by more than 11 miles per hour,
and another 7,000 were caught
driving 16 to 25 miles per hour over the limit. And apparently,
they only took measurements at one of all 33 camera locations! Now,
the laws of the state of California require that the authority cannot
automatically send out fines. Each ticket must be manually reviewed
by an employee. With two minutes of review time per ticket, that
would provide bread and work for about 200 new city employees. And
the city urgently needs an economic miracle!

Unlike speed cameras in Germany, the new cameras in San Francisco do
not identify the driver but only the license plate of the speeding
vehicle. The ticket is then sent to the vehicle's DMV registered owner.
If the owner then feels they are not
responsible, they can file a written objection and name the actual
driver. This seems legally shaky to me, but it is supposedly
permissible since it only involves civil law violations. The caught
speeders will pay fines to the city, but won't receive any points on their
record. Additionally, nothing is reported to the vehicle owner's
insurance, unlike with police-issued fines.

@Z: San Francisco's Upper Great Highway becomes car-free 'Sand Dunes Park'

<pic images/ugh-road.ps The Upper Great Highway is now closed to cars.>

TODO

<em>Angelika</em> 
Did you know that in San Francisco, the coastal road at Ocean Beach
has recently been closed to cars? Here's how it happened: During
COVID, the city's transportation department in San Francisco came up
with the brilliant idea of establishing so-called "Slow Streets,"
which are traffic-calmed roads where pedestrians and children on
bicycles could spread out.
<RBLINK>20200911#5</RBLINK>
...So you didn't feel so confined. The 'Slow Streets' still allowed
access for residents and suppliers. They were not completely closed
to cars. The program was so popular in San Francisco that some 'Slow
Streets' were maintained even after the pandemic, such as Sanchez
Street around the corner from us, which we still frequently use for
our walks.

San Francisco is famously located on the Pacific Ocean and has
several city beaches in the western part of the city. "Ocean Beach"
is the longest. Directly adjacent to "Ocean Beach" is the "Great
Highway," a four-lane access road. "Highway" sounds somewhat
grandiose because it brings to mind German autobahns. However, in the
USA, "highways" generally refer to roads that can vary greatly in
width and development. A "freeway" is more akin to a generously
designed autobahn. I would describe the "Great Highway" more as a
larger city street that, as mentioned, runs along the ocean beach.

The street has only a few traffic lights, and drivers make good
progress. In April 2020, during the pandemic, the city closed a
two-mile (3.2 km) section of the Great Highway, the so-called "Upper
Great Highway," between Lincoln Avenue and Sloat Boulevard, so that
the public could engage in physical activities there. This closure
was also very popular, and no cars were allowed to drive on this
section.

<pic images/ugh-truck.ps The rushing newsletter reporter supervises
the construction work by bicycle.>

At the beginning of the pandemic, this was not a problem at all, as
many people were working from home and traffic was light. Residents
simply diverted to the side streets. But soon, voices grew louder to
lift the closure. Supporters faced off against those residents who
were annoyed by the traffic on the side streets with stop signs at
every intersection. And lo and behold, in our city, where compromises
are rare and everything is always debated and contested passionately
and intensely, an agreement was reached in August 2021. The section
remained closed to car traffic from Friday afternoon through the
weekend and on public holidays. However, on weekdays, cars were
allowed to speed through. Everyone had to give a little, but each
side also got something they wanted.

<pic images/ugh-paint.ps Artists are painting the once busy street.>

In English, that's called a "win-win situation." This could have put
the issue to rest, but wait, that would be too easy. The compromise
that was worked out was limited as a pilot project and was set to
expire at the end of 2025. The city wanted to collect data to see how
much the closed section was used by pedestrians and cyclists, and
what the impacts on traffic flows were. I have no idea why the data
collection took four years, but such things are not unusual in this
city. Instead of properly evaluating the data and then deciding in
the city council whether the pilot project could continue as is or if
changes needed to be made, they preferred to rely on the
tried-and-true method of voter referendum through the so-called
proposition (roughly translated as a citizens' initiative). Five city
representatives and our then-mayor, London Breed, ensured that
Proposition K was on our ballot in November 2024, coinciding with the
mayoral election in this city, and therefore a high voter turnout was
expected.

<pic images/ugh-paint-ocean.ps Artists paint so-called murals on the
street.>

An intense battle immediately erupted between the supporters and the
opponents. Now you must know that these propositions are often
tricky, because at first glance everything sounds just great.
However, when you delve into the details, which only a few voters do,
it looks quite different. Proposition K, for example, promised that
not only would the 2-mile section be permanently closed to car
traffic, but the road would be completely transformed into a park. Of
course, everyone generally wants a nice new park right by the sea.
What could be against that? But Proposition K only promised the park,
without plans for its financing or even ideas for its design.

<pic images/ugh-rock-1.ps A boulder for the park is being brought in
...>

<pic images/ugh-rock-2.ps The translation of "... und installiert."
to English is "... and installed.>

Additionally, the Great Highway faces challenges with large sand
drifts several times a year due to its proximity to the ocean and the
beach, and anyone planning a park must take this into account. On
election day in November, 54% of citizens voted in favor of
Proposition K, and as a result, the "Upper Great Highway" has been
permanently closed to all vehicle traffic since March 14 of this
year. Interestingly, most of the "no" votes for Proposition K came
from the districts bordering the ocean, namely the "Outer Richmond"
and "Sunset" neighborhoods. On the other hand, this is not
surprising, as the people living there are the most affected by the
closure in their daily lives.

<pic images/prop-k-by-district.ps Only residents in other districts
support the closure.>

Many of them found it unfair that their voices didn't carry more
weight. Consequently, there were efforts to remove city council
member Joel Engardio, who represents the Sunset District and had
advocated for the highway closure and the park, through a recall
process. This is a common strategy among the politically dissatisfied
in this city and in California in general. Nevertheless, the same
Joel Engardio officially opened the new park in mid-April, now
officially named "Sunset Dunes Park.

<pic images/ugh-mural-wide.ps The translation of "KÃ¼nstler bemalen
die StraÃe ..." to English is "Artists are painting the street ...>

<pic images/ugh-mural.ps ... on which cars were still driving until
recently.>

Currently, this only means that a few artworks have been painted on
the street. Sculptures and fitness equipment are supposedly to
follow. Art is always good. Otherwise, the city plans to use the
funding from the California Coastal Conservancy, one million dollars,
to explore how the new park will affect traffic and the environment.
It will also be examined how the potential rise in sea level might,
in turn, impact the park. Ahhh, we've been here before, so the circle
closes.

@Z: Car failed the smog test.

<pic images/intake-replace.ps The old air filter is being replaced by
an intake manifold for racing cars.>

<em>Michael</em> 
I have often expressed in our publication that there is no TÃV
(Technical Inspection Association) in America. Some states really
allow any vehicle on four wheels to drive on the highways, but
California tends to overregulate in this area as well. Every
registered motor vehicle must pass the so-called smog test every two
years (older vehicles even every year).

<pic images/low-rider.ps No TÃV approval but legal in California.>

Recently, I learned firsthand that the test not only evaluates the
exhaust gases escaping from the tailpipe, but the inspector also goes
through a checklist with at most a peripheral connection. For
example, the gas cap must seal airtight; if it doesn't, the onboard
computer will display an error message, and the emissions inspector
will refuse to give the stamp.

<pic images/smog-test-fail.ps (#5) Failed the smog test due to cracks
in the air filter hose.>

Recently, it happened to me when I cheerfully drove our aging Acura
Integra, affectionately called "Rocket," to the smog center and, to
my great astonishment, learned that our car had failed the smog test.
I knew that in California, you can't continue to register a car
without passing the smog test, and a slight unease set in. However, I
found out that our Rocket hadn't exceeded the permissible emission
levels; instead, a manual inspection of the engine compartment by the
smog technician had discovered a crack in the hose to the air filter.

Such a small mishap should, of course, be fixed by oneself, even with
a 27-year-old car with 300,000 kilometers on the clock, because
otherwise, the engine will suck in soot particles instead of filtered
air and ruin its interior. But honestly, I was surprised to learn
that the smog inspector has TÃV-like authority when it comes to
identifying defects. Anyway, I set about repairing the hose and, to
my utter astonishment, also discovered that the spare part was no
longer available and was only sporadically traded on eBay at
astronomical prices, even when used.

<pic images/intake-box.ps Air filter from Rennsemmel-Versand.>

Now, one must know that Japanese cars from the 1990s are still
considered popular racing machines among young speedsters in San
Francisco. Our model, an Acura Integra GSR, continues to enjoy lively
interest in the "Fast and Furious" tuning scene. With only 170
horsepower, the vehicle, reminiscent of an Opel Manta, may not be
exciting by today's standards, but it produces an infernal Formula
One howl at 8000 revolutions per minute, just before the red zone
begins. Not being foolish, I ordered an intake manifold for racing
machines from a tuning supplier and installed it in place of the
regular air filter.

<pic images/intake-installed.ps The racing air filter is fully
installed.>

That went relatively smoothly after I had to rearrange some hoses in
the engine compartment due to space constraints, from which coolant
aggressively gushed out when I unplugged them. Now we have a
brand-new racing air filter in a 27-year-old engine. When I went to
the smog guy for the (free) retest, all the emission values were
correct, and he waved me through. I also bought an extra $200 filter
that had the California certification (CARB), which would have only
cost $50 in other states. Thanks, California!

Recently, I drove up to the oil change guy, and he immediately waved
his colleagues over to show them the new part in the engine
compartment. And our car now sounds normal when idling, but at higher
speeds, it makes a noise that makes other drivers immediately take
notice and respectfully move to the right lanes. That's how it should
be. It's funny what unexpected side effects government overregulation
can produce.

@Z: Trump II" is already in English. It likely refers to a second
term or iteration involving Donald Trump, such as a hypothetical
second presidency or a sequel to something associated with him. If
you have more context or a specific phrase you need translated,
please provide additional details.

<pic images/eorder-wh.ps President Trump signs an executive order.>

<em>Angelika</em> 
We already know that you are eagerly waiting to hear how things are
going for us in Trumphausen. As expected, there is such a mess and
chaos that it's hard to keep up. Tariffs up and down. Stock market up
and down. Visas are revoked and then reinstated. People in government
agencies are fired and then rehired because it turns out that certain
positions cannot be left vacant. The speed at which things are being
introduced and pushed through with brute force is surprising and
surely intentional, as so many things are happening simultaneously
that even seasoned journalists and political observers can't keep up.
Meanwhile, as an ordinary citizen, you still have to manage your
daily life.

Through the German press, you are surely quite well informed about
what is currently happening in the USA, but I wanted to shed light on
something that I have long considered a major problem. The USA claims
to be a solid democracy with a firm separation of powers, where all
three branches--namely the executive, legislative, and judicial--are
equal, independent, and subject to mutual control ("checks and
balances"). However, there are some very large loopholes that
undermine this system and have not been closed so far because
everyone has relied on the assumption that no one would ruthlessly
exploit these loopholes.

As one of the largest and, in my opinion, most undemocratic excesses,
I see governing by decrees, so-called "Executive Orders," in the US
government system. These are presidential directives that come into
effect without the approval of Congress--an instrument originally
intended to ensure the efficiency of the executive branch, but today
increasingly used as a tool to bypass the legislature. Although all
presidents have used this method so far, Donald Trump is really
taking it to the extreme in his second term, even though he has a -
albeit narrow - majority of his Republican Party in both houses. By
the way, Joe Biden signed 162 decrees during his term, Barack Obama
signed 277 in eight years, and Bill Clinton issued 364 in the same
eight-year period. Donald Trump issued 220 Executive Orders in his
first term--and in his second term, he is already...
<LINK>https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executiv
e-orders|The phrase "bei 103|Executive Orders" can be translated to
English as "at 103|Executive Orders." However, the context is not
entirely clear. If "bei" is part of a specific title or reference, it
might not need translation. If you have more context, I could provide
a more accurate translation.</LINK>
.

In my opinion, decrees should only be used in absolute emergencies,
such as a natural disaster or pandemic, to allow for swift action.
Instead, democratic processes are being undermined to avoid the
effort of passing laws. Interestingly, the term "Executive Order"
does not appear in the American Constitution. The legal basis is
usually Article II of the Constitution, which grants the President
executive power--with the obligation to "ensure that the laws are
faithfully executed," although this is a very vague formulation.
Decrees must not violate existing laws and are not considered laws
themselves. This leads to what we are currently experiencing. There
is an increase in lawsuits challenging the legality of the decrees.
Since decrees are not laws, any new president can immediately revoke
them, which happens regularly.

I see another problem in the unrestricted pardons that a president
can issue with a stroke of a pen. This should only happen in absolute
exceptional cases. However, it has become customary for presidents to
quickly pardon various individuals just before the end of their term.
Often, humanitarian considerations are not the main focus, but rather
their own political or familial connections. For example, Bill
Clinton pardoned Marc Rich in 2001, who had fled to avoid prosecution
for tax evasion and fraud. His wife had donated large sums to the
Democratic Party and Clinton's library. Gerald Ford pardoned Richard
Nixon in 1974 for possible crimes during his presidency, after Nixon
resigned due to the Watergate scandal. I was particularly
disappointed that Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden, even
though he had previously insisted that he would never consider doing
so. I also find it absolutely absurd that he pardoned some family
members prophylactically, even though there were no convictions. It
seems no one has integrity anymore. Everyone looks out for themselves
and justifies their own misconduct with that of others. Trump then
issued blanket pardons to all those convicted for storming the
Capitol on January 6, without distinguishing who had committed acts
of violence. Some of those pardoned are already back in prison for
new offenses.

<pic images/ppardon.ps President Biden signs a presidential pardon.>

The American Constitution grants the President extensive powers
regarding pardons in Article II, Section 2: "The President shall have
the power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the
United States, except in cases of impeachment." What does this mean
exactly? The President can grant full pardons, commutations, and
reprieves without needing the approval of Congress or the courts.
However, these pardons only apply to federal offenses and not to
crimes at the state level, for which the individual governors of the
states are responsible. As mentioned, impeachment cases are also
excluded.

The Supreme Court, that is, the American Supreme Court, then made a
consequential ruling in July 2024 regarding the criminal immunity of
the President. The court decided by a vote of 6 to 3 that a (former)
President enjoys at least a presumed immunity for actions that belong
to their official duties. This means that prosecution is only
possible if it is proven that the charge does not impair the
constitutional function of the President. For certain areas, such as
the appointment of officials or the exercise of the pardon power,
there is even absolute immunity, meaning the President cannot be
criminally prosecuted for these actions at all. There is no immunity
for private and non-official actions. Therefore, in these cases,
courts must first determine whether the matters are official or
private.

And then, in a modern democracy, perhaps care should be taken to
ensure that ancient laws that are still officially in force are not
suddenly dug up. For example, the Trump administration is currently
basing deportations to El Salvador on the Alien Enemies Act of 1798,
which allows the president to detain or deport citizens of so-called
enemy nations without a court trial during a state of war. The
application of the law was justified by declaring the Venezuelan gang
"Tren de Aragua," which operates on American soil, as a hostile
entity.

<pic images/senate.ps The Senate is actually supposed to pass laws.>

I'm waiting for us to maybe hear something from the members of
Congress every now and then. There's really almost complete silence.
Do they not want to govern anymore? The opposition hasn't reorganized
yet either, and the Democratic Party is still licking its wounds and
coming up with old, outdated ideas. Time is running out, let's get
going.

@Z: The translation of "Neumodische HÃ¼llenmaschinen" to English is

<pic images/ssm-1.ps Fast and casual, but extremely dangerous>

<em>Michael</em> 
Who hasn't noticed that nowadays even older grandpas are zipping
through city streets on e-bikes as if they've been stung by a
tarantula, turning even remote forest trails into death traps?

<pic images/inmotion.ps The translation to English is: "Cave device

<pic images/inmotion-ggp.ps These unicycles can travel up to 50

Electromobility is taking increasingly bizarre forms here. First came
the e-bikes, where you still had to pedal a bit to get some boost
from the battery. Then came these murderously fast moped-like
machines, which really only differ from a motorcycle that requires a
license in that they don't make any noise on their journey. And, of
course, the skateboards with electric drives, often spotted as
hipster transport. And they all crowd onto the narrow bike paths of
the city. Classic cyclists duck their heads in fright.

<pic images/ssm-2.ps Armor with an integral helmet doesn't help in an
emergency either.>

And finally, there are what I call "suicide machines," e-motorized
unicycles, either as a board on a thick rubber roller or with a wheel
the size of a folding bike, through the hub of which a rod passes,
with two footrests on the left and right. The rider stands on it, and
like a Segway, the device balances itself while the rider propels it
forward by leaning forward or slows it down by leaning back.

<pic images/ssm-3.ps The translation of the German sentence "Sogar
Opa Meume fÃ¤hrt noch todesmutig." to English is: "Even Grandpa Meume
still drives daringly.>

I have already seen with my own eyes how lunatics on these electric
scooters have raced through the dense city traffic at surely 50 miles
per hour, weaving between cars stuck in traffic, and seemingly
completely ignoring the fact that one in a hundred cars could change
lanes and send the daredevil flying high into the air like Evil
Knievel once did.

<pic images/ssm-powell.ps Shoved in the train station>

The problem is not the bike itself, as cyclists also survive in city
traffic, but rather the extreme speed of these vehicles. The speeding
is not legal; the maximum allowable speed in California is 15 mph (24
km/h). Nevertheless, there are shops here in San Francisco that sell
souped-up vehicles that go twice as fast.

<pic images/ssm-kennedy.ps Hell machine driver (Arrow) races through
Golden Gate Park.>

To ensure the store is on the safe side legally, it sells the part
with a switch that, in its normal position, limits the vehicle's
speed to the legal value. However, the customer can then flip the
switch themselves and zoom around at double the speed. Of course,
this is illegal, but our police do not (yet) check for such things.

The translation from German to English is: "Greetings from the crazy
country!
