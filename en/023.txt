@Z: Ikea, Finally

<em>Michael</em> In November '99, I reported once before that a large Ikea was
supposed to open in Oakland, right on the opposite side of the San Francisco
Bay. As a European, one probably can't imagine what it means to live without
Ikea. The nearest store here was 400 miles further south, in Los Angeles! Well,
the Oakland store opening finally came true, and it was announced with great
fanfare. During the first few days, a raffle was drawn every hour, and whoever
was standing in the checkout line won their purchases without having to pay
anything. One weekend, we managed to stop by.

Coming from Munich originally, where there is regularly the so-called "Ikea
Jam" on the autobahn offramp into Eching on weekends, we were used to
the hype quite a bit, but we had never seen anything like this. The new Ikea in
Oakland is indeed huge and features a gigantic parking lot the size as a
football stadium, but the crowds were so large that security guards had to
temporarily close the lot. The vehicles were then guided with red cones into an
opaque maze, at the end of which they found themselves back on the highway
before they knew it. We knew the area, drove to a nearby industrial area, and
walked back to the store.

<pic images/ikea5.ps Finally: An IKEA in Oakland near San Francisco.>

<pic images/ikea2.ps Enthusiastic Americans are flocking to the Swedish furniture store.>

A line of people had formed in front of the entrance. To prevent
people from trampling each other inside, they were only allowed in
small groups, and only when some left the store, others were allowed
to move in. The waiting time was about one to two hours--just to get
into the store. That was too silly for us, so we drove home, planning
to return a few weeks later when the excitement would have subsided a bit.

This time, we just managed to find a parking spot, immediately entered the
store, and strolled through the aisles. Ikeas look the same all over the world:
upstairs is for furniture displays, you mentally select what you want, and then
pick it up downstairs. Once downstairs, instead of the selected piece of
furniture, you find a red note on the corresponding shelf indicating that the
item is out of stock. Frustrated, you buy a 100-pack of tea lights. The Ikea in
Oakland, however, took it a step further: when we got downstairs, we only saw
completely empty shelves--I was reminded of a visit to a department store in
East Berlin in the mid-80s! Frustrated, we didn't even buy a 100-pack of tea
lights but rather a useless little wooden box with drawers that were far too
small, and we drove home. 

The local press has already taken up the topic of "Ikea"--in an article
in the San Francisco Examiner.

<pic images/ikea4.ps Some people drive Ikea stuff home in a convertible.>

Meanwhile, the local press has taken on the subject, the
<LINK>http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/examiner/archive/2000/07/23/MAGAZINE10381.dtl|a story in the San Francisco Examiner</LINK>
suggested to simply sell tickets in front of the entrance to at least make it
look like a museum visit if no furniture could be found.

@Z: Bay to Breakers

<pic images/b2bm3.ps The racecourse of the Bay-to-Breakers run across San Francisco.>

<em>Michael</em> 
As every year, the "Bay to Breakers" city run took place in May, and
your esteemed narrator participated, continuing on a developing tradition. This has
already been reported in the newsletter, but since one particular newsletter
reader, whom I won't name here (Günter Speckhofer, the editor),
recently asked again what "Bay to Breakers" actually means, here are
the facts once more: It's a fun race from the San Francisco Bay in
the east, across the city to the ocean in the west (Breakers are the
incoming waves), with 70,000 people participating. Many compete in
costumes or in groups, and the streets are closed off.

The old <RBLINK>19990603#1</RBLINK> you can look up on the internet,
by the way. This year, I ran at an easy pace
and finished with a time of 01:25:37, placing 8,151st out of 52,356
runners who reached the finish line. 01:25:37 is still not impressive
for 9 miles, but you have to account for a waiting time of about 15
minutes at the start line. That's how long it took for the crowd of 70,000
people to start moving from the spot where I was.

<pic images/b2ba1.ps Two runners wearing body paint.>

<pic images/b2ba2.ps Grandpa is also walking along with a handcart.>

As always, the whole race is of course documented online. Race
management has published the this <LINK>http://www.active.com/breakers/results2000/results_list.cfm?keywords=schilli&type=name">www.baytobreakers.com|link</LINK>:
Just type "Schilli" into the search box labeled "How'd I do?" and there you
go. You can also see that Reuben Cheruiyot from Kenia was even faster: It took
himt only 34 minutes and 54 seconds, and that landed him the number one spot.

<pic images/b2bme.ps Bay to Breakers: Finish line photo, one of the newsletter writers is on the far right.>

Also, recently, I read a book by
German Minister of Foreign Affairs Joschka Fischer, titled
<LINK>https://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3462027948|"Mein langer Lauf zu mir selbst"</LINK>,
in which he boasts that in 1998, he ran the Hamburg marathon in 3:41:36.
Now, a marathon is 26 miles, and I ran 9 miles, so this makes his 9 mile
time, crunch, crunch, 01:03:01. What, the old man is faster than
I am? Outrageous! Wait until I'm 50 ...

@Z: Speaking American with the Pros

<em>Michael</em> 
And here is the segment "Learn to Speak American with the Pros"
again! Today, we start with two words used to describe big shots,
self-important people, and busybodies: "Bigwig" (literally: "Big
Wig") and, as I like to say, "Muckety-Muck" (pronounced:
"Mackettimack," with emphasis on the first "a" and the second "a").
"The big muckety-muck decided otherwise again!" -- the boss changed
his mind again. By the way, at Netscape, seven people from our group
have formed a basketball team that plays in the Netscape internal
tournament and is called the "Muckety-Mucks." Which, of course, is
meant ironically!

And, since we were talking about restaurants earlier: If you can't
finish your meal and want to take it home, you ask, "Could you get me
a doggie-bag, please?" A bag for the dog, even if you plan to eat the
stuff yourself later. The server will pack the leftovers into a small
Styrofoam or plastic container without batting an eye. At home, it's
usually reheated in the microwave the next day. Or not! We've
gradually stopped doing that because it generally leads to the stuff
rotting in the fridge for two weeks and then being taken out and
thrown away with a pinch of the fingers.

@Z: US-Warenkorb

<em>Michael</em> 
We've been living abroad for almost four years now! Every time
visitors from Germany arrive here in San Francisco, we become aware
of this fact. I think about 20 people visited us this summer -- let's
see if I can remember them all: (GÃ¼nter, Thomas & Helmut & Konrad,
Matthias, Fritz & Traudl, Ursel & Peter, Heinz & Ursel & Bernd &
Julian & Yves-Ole, Susanne, Christian, Markus).

<pic images/touris1.ps Always funny: Tourists!>

A popular ongoing topic among German tourists is, of course,
complaining about the rather high dollar exchange rate! Oh, how
expensive the goods are! We noticed that we have no idea anymore what
these things actually cost in Germany. That's why today we have put
together a newsletter shopping basket: typical items and services and
what you pay for them in San Francisco (as of June 1, 2000). For some
things, your jaw will surely drop:


\begin{tabular}[t]{p{5cm}rr}

@Z: The translation of "Was Deutsche falsch machen in Amerika" to
English is "What Germans do wrong in America.

<em>Michael</em> 
Now to our new section: What Germans always do wrong in America. They
sit down in a restaurant, and when the waiter comes and asks what
they would like to order, they say, "I take the steak." Aaah! This
immediately reveals the person ordering as a German tourist, because
Americans say, "I'll have the steak, please." At the latest, this is
when the waiter starts whispering with their colleagues and rolling
their eyes, because Germans don't have a good reputation in the
American dining scene. The reason: In Germany, there's a 5% tip, at
most, while in America, the waiter expects at least 15%, and in
better restaurants, even 20%.

The German groans: Oh dear, oh dear, the high dollar exchange rate!
And in San Francisco, a meal for two in a fairly normal restaurant
can quickly cost 50 dollars. Then giving an additional 8 to 10
dollars as a tip really hurts the German's wallet. What he doesn't
consider, however, is that the waiter works for a minimum wage and
earns his income from tips. Unlike in Germany, where every server is
legally covered by pension, health, and social insurance, people here
usually have to pay for their insurance out of their own pocket. To
withhold a tip from a waiter just because one is too stingy is
considered a mortal sin; an American would never do that, it would be
like taking a beggar's hat away.

Out of ignorance or stubbornness, many German tourists behave
inappropriately, leaving only a few dollars as a tip and ruining the
server's day. This behavior has now led to waitstaff in tourist
centers immediately adding a 15% surcharge to the bill when they hear
German being spoken at the table--too many bad experiences with
guests from Germany. Therefore, folks, when you're here in the USA,
do me a favor: adapt to the local customs and leave a good tip. Don't
use the freedom that the restaurant gives you to shortchange the
people who work there.

That's why today we're going to go over how to enter a restaurant in
America, order, eat, and then pay with a credit card or cash. You
walk in, and there's usually a "Maitre d'" who assigns you a seat --
you only seat yourself in student cafes. He/she might ask something
like "How are you today?", to which you respond with something like
"I'm pretty good, thank you!" To the question "How many?" you answer
"Party of two" if there are two of you, and respectively "three,"
"four," etc. if there are three or four of you. "Two for lunch" or
"Two for dinner" also works for lunch or dinner. Then you're led to
the table, sit down, and receive the menu. When the waiter comes back
shortly after, they will ask something like "Have you had a chance to
decide yet?" to see if you're ready to order. If you're not ready yet
because translating the menu is taking a bit longer, you simply say
"Sorry, we're gonna need a couple of minutes." However, you can
already order something to drink. If there's no beer on the menu, you
ask "What kind of beer do you have on tap?" to find out what draft
beers are available. By the way, in America, there's almost always
beer available, even at the fanciest luxury Italian restaurant, even
if it's not always on the menu. As always in America: Always ask,
never be shy. The server might also ask if you're interested in the
"Specials," usually dishes that are particularly fresh or recommended
today. If you say "Sure!", they will immediately list them, and you
have to pay attention to catch everything. If you decide on one of
the "Specials" or something from the menu, you order your stuff with
the previously covered "I'll have" phrase -- done.

When the food arrives, the server usually asks if you would like
anything else, such as ketchup, Parmesan cheese (often pronounced
pseudo-Italian as "Parmashan" with nasal sounds more commonly found
in French), or freshly ground pepper ("fresh pepper"), and then you
may start eating. After a few minutes, the server comes by again and
asks, "Everything okay?" to which you naturally respond, if
everything is good, "Excellent!

So, now for the payment. Usually, the waiter comes by and asks, "Can
I get you anything else?" If you respond with "No, thanks, we're just
fine," they usually bring the bill themselves. Sometimes, in more
affordable establishments, the server will place the bill on the
table without being asked and say, "Whenever you're ready." This is
not meant to be impolite; it's standard practice there. You can more
clearly ask for the bill by saying, "Could you get us the check,
please?" This has nothing to do with a "check" as in a bank check;
it's simply what Americans call the bill. If you learned "bill" in
school, you'll quickly forget it, as that's British and frowned upon.

And soon the server will come by with a small tray or folder
containing the bill. If you're paying by credit card, which is
common, you simply place your card on the tray or in the folder, with
a bit of it sticking out so the waiter can see it when they pass by
next. When they see the card sticking out, they take the tray/folder,
charge the amount to the credit card, and then return it, this time
with a so-called credit card slip, a small receipt like the one you
see in Figure 10.

<pic images/cc3m.ps Credit card slip for the restaurant>

Only now is the tip entered. In Figure 10, you can see that the meal
cost $32.39. 15% of that would be $4.86, but since I'm not stingy, I
entered $5.50 in the "Tip" field. Then everything is added up, and
$37.89 is the total amount. Since you probably don't always have a
calculator with you, here's a rule of thumb: divide the bill amount
by 6, and you'll get a good tip. In this case, $32.39 doesn't divide
exactly by 6, but since 5 * 6 = 30 and 6 * 6 = 36, you're safe with
5.50. Then quickly sign -- and you're done! As proof for later, you
should definitely keep the copy of the receipt, which is usually
yellow, while the original receipt for the restaurant is white.
Sometimes the original says "Merchant Copy" and the copy says
"Customer Copy," as shown in Figure 11. You don't need to sign it, as
it's just for you, but to Angelika's dismay, I always use the receipt
to practice my most flamboyant signatures. But I digress.

Are you ready? You don't have to wait for the waiter to come back;
you simply leave the receipt on the tray, get up, and leave the
restaurant. It's that simple!

<pic images/cc3c.ps Credit card slip for the customer (copy)>

Here's a translation to English:

"One more thing: A persistent mistake is writing ones with a serif,
as is common in German regions. However, they also write sevens with
a crossbar there, which Americans do not do. This is particularly
critical on credit card statements, as ones written in the German
style can be interpreted by Americans as sevens. In Figure 11, you
can see how the seven in the amount of $37.89 is written without a
crossbar -- this is the usual practice here. It looks surprisingly
like a one, doesn't it? So, if you mean 'one,' please just write a
vertical line. Figure 12 illustrates this again. It concerns a letter
I once received that miraculously arrived, even though letters
addressed so incorrectly are lost 90% of the time, as experience has
shown. Also, the apartment number is not 16, but 6. This usually
means the end for the letter, as the mail carrier does not pay
attention to the nameplates on the mailbox; it is purely based on
house number and apartment number. If either is missing, the letter
immediately goes into the trash bin; there is no investigation like
with the German postal service.

<pic images/addrf.ps A letter addressed to me -- wrong, incorrigible
& typically German!>

In Figure 12, all the ones are written with an upward stroke -- they
are interpreted here as sevens, and the house number 7765 simply
doesn't exist on Church Street. Figure 13 shows how it's done
correctly: ones are just vertical lines, which the mail carrier can
read without any problems.

<pic images/addrc.ps The translation to English is: "That's right --
ones without a serif.>

Translate to English: One more thing: It is completely impossible to
pay the bill separately in a restaurant. The server has no idea who
had what and will not go around to find out, as is common in Germany.
However, what you can do is simply put in, for example, two credit
cards and ask if it would be possible to charge both equally. Each
person must then enter their tip separately. Another option is to pay
in cash and pool the money, the easiest way being to divide the total
amount by the number of people present. Saying, "But I only had a
small salad and you had the 2-pound rib-eye steak!" and calculating
proportionally is considered stingy, but you have to work that out
among yourselves. You should always just order the most expensive
dish, then you'll be on the safe side.

I still need to catch up on how to pay with cash: You also ask for
the bill here, and when the little folder/tray comes, there are two
options again: Either you have the exact amount including (!) the
pre-calculated tip ready. Then you place the exact amount, stand up,
and leave. Really, you can leave the establishment immediately; the
server will only check your bills after you are out on the street. If
necessary, they will come running after you, don't worry.

If you don't have the exact change, just put in enough large bills to
cover the bill plus a tip. This is an excellent method to get rid of
the large 50 and 100 bills that German banks like to give to
tourists, which they then can't use anywhere because hardly any store
accepts bills larger than 20. However, restaurants take everything
because they can check the bills behind the scenes. Then the server
comes back, and if they don't immediately understand what's going on,
you simply ask, "Can we get some change, please?" They will take the
tray/pouch with the large bills and bring back change according to
the bill amount. But be careful: no tip has been included yet. You've
already calculated this beforehand, and now you only take as much of
the change as needed to leave the exact tip you calculated, leave it
in the pouch/tray, stand up, and leave. Why did I say earlier that
you should put in enough money to cover the bill plus (!) the tip?
Exactly, so that you have the necessary small change to leave the
tip. Otherwise, you might find out afterward that you don't have
enough, have to ask again, and that's uncool. It doesn't matter if
the bills far exceed the bill amount or if there's even an extra bill
in there. For example, if the bill is 36 dollars, but you only have
three twenties, just put in the three twenties -- the servers are
smart enough to give you back 24 dollars in change in small enough
denominations so you can leave a 6 dollar tip.

In remote areas or very simple pubs, it might be the case that you
have to pay at the register. In that case, the server brings the
bill, you get up, take it to the register, pay the bill amount
without (!) a tip, return to the table, and leave the tip on the
table. Whether you pay at the register in a restaurant or the server
takes care of it, you can easily find out by observing the other
guests or simply asking for the bill and waiting half an hour for the
server. Then it's pretty certain!

Since I'm already on the topic: How does it work in a bar? Usually,
one person goes to the counter, gets drinks for everyone, and pays in
cash immediately. You get your change back right away, and you leave
a little bit as a tip, around 10% or so. Ordering and paying for beer
separately is uncommon; it's considered "Dutch," as in Dutch treat. I
have no idea why, but that's not what Americans do. Someone always
buys a round.

I hope you're not thinking now, "My God, the old man is completely
crazy!" Your intrepid newsletter reporter has spent years exploring
restaurants and pubs in all areas of America, from Texas to Chicago,
from Miami to Seattle, to share this knowledge with you today and
ensure that you get by well everywhere!

Angelika discovered during her photography courses that traditional
SLR cameras do not deliver the image quality that she envisions,
ahem, ahem. In fact, there are so-called medium format cameras, whose
negatives are 6 by 6 (or 6 by 7, depending on the model) centimeters
in size, which is about four times the area of conventional films.
This results in double the resolution and stunning image quality --
however, the cameras for this are quite bulky and expensive. But in
San Francisco, there are photo shops where you can rent such a camera
for just a little money over the weekend, and that's what we did when
we recently went down to San Luis Obispo (about halfway between San
Francisco and Los Angeles) for a long weekend.

<pic images/pmam.ps The "Perlman" before the mission near the city of
San Luis Obispo>

First, there was a Mamiya 7, a bulky rangefinder camera that's about
twice the size of a regular SLR and has a 6 by 7 centimeter negative.
And on the next trip to the "Lassen Volcanic National Park," it was a
Hasselblad 503, which I affectionately call "Otzen." You know, those
brick-sized cameras from Sweden that you look into from above. To
load the film, you have to carefully study the manual, then press
various levers, turn screws, and maneuver film spools back and forth.
It hardly takes less than 5 minutes. A roll of film has only 12
pictures. The film is wound after each picture with an old-fashioned
crank on the side of the camera, which you turn in a circle like a
barrel organ.

<pic images/mamiya1.ps Angelika with the Mamiya 7>

When you press the shutter release, the camera makes a dull sound
that can be heard within a 50-meter radius and sounds like Mike Tyson
punching a sandbag. Every professional has such a camera, and if you
look closely next time when Karl Lagerfeld's new collection is being
photographed, you will see one of these black boxes with
chrome-flashing edges in the photographer's hand. An assistant will
be busily occupied with loading new film and handing the photographer
cameras always loaded with fresh film. Angelika tirelessly carried
the heavy piece on our hikes and took photos diligently. Once, when
Angelika was busily handling the separate light meter and the hefty
camera in the national park, a tourist actually asked if she was a
geologist. Haha! Make way for Angelika!

<pic images/otzen.ps The female photographer with the Hasselblad 503>

<em>Angelika</em> 
So, now I want to have my say as well. Michael has already mentioned
my tireless effort to find a suitable medium format camera for
myself. No purchase decision has been made yet, but I'm working on
it. In addition to testing cameras, I also learned last semester how
to develop and enlarge color images myself. Color and black-and-white
photography are quite different. With color, in addition to the fact
that the color balance must be perfect, there's the added difficulty
that you can't work under red light, but only in complete darkness.
After some practice, I managed to handle things in the dark quite
well and proudly brought home my first color enlargements.

Yes, and I also sold my first black-and-white photo. I received a
smooth $200 (including matting) for it, even though I only asked for
$120. And Michael just can't understand how someone would voluntarily
pay more. But the buyer simply felt that my photo was worth that much
to her. Yay!!!

@Z: The translation of "Abenteuer SpÃ¼lmaschine" to English is
"Dishwasher Adventure.

<em>Angelika</em> 
And I want to report on another groundbreaking event. After almost
four years, we bought a dishwasher. Now, you might not find this too
exciting, but I tell you, anyone who knows how much Michael and I
hate washing dishes, and anyone who has visited us and experienced
firsthand how the dishes pile up and had to join in the dishwashing
routine, will not only be happy for us but will thank us on their
knees. Hey, stop the eye-rolling and gossiping. Now comes the funny
part of the story. In our kitchen, it is impossible to install a
dishwasher because the cabinets next to the sink are built in such a
way that they can't be moved even a centimeter. This, by the way,
seems to be a very common problem in American rental apartments,
because there are rolling dishwashers available for purchase. Maybe
you can't quite imagine it, but as the name suggests, you roll the
dishwasher to the sink, connect it to the faucet, and off you go.
This is, of course, not the most elegant solution in the world, as
the machine then stands right in the way, and in our case, since our
kitchen is so small, you can't reach the refrigerator or any cabinets
when it's in operation. Yes, go ahead and laugh, I also wonder daily
how it can be that in the land of unlimited possibilities, one
sometimes feels transported back to the Stone Age, but we will put up
with anything as long as we don't have to wash dishes anymore. By the
way, we got the machine through Michael's colleague and friend Greg.
He moved from Mountain View to San Francisco and, lo and behold, his
new apartment already had a built-in dishwasher. So he offered to
sell us his rolling one. Since he assured us that it is quiet and
doesn't shake the whole house (that was our fear that had kept us
from buying one before--you know, we live in a wooden house and the
neighbor below us is a nagging goat), we are now proud owners of a
dishwasher again. HURRAY!!!

<pic images/spueli.ps The new rolling dishwasher>

@Z: The translation of "Mietbedingungen in San Francisco" to English
is "Rental conditions in San Francisco.

<em>Angelika</em> 
Michael went to the trouble of putting together a shopping basket for
you. At first, you might have thought that the price of $2000 for a
two-bedroom apartment in our neighborhood was a typo. If only it
were! Unfortunately, the dizzyingly high rents are a harsh reality in
San Francisco.

Many of you already know that we pay "only" $1100 for our two-bedroom
apartment. This is solely due to the fact that there is something as
social as rent control in San Francisco, which is quite unusual in
capitalist America. Generally, the market strictly dictates prices
here: if demand is high, prices are correspondingly high. Rent
control in San Francisco simply means that the rent can only be
increased by a certain percentage each year. This percentage is
determined annually by an authority called the San Francisco Rent
Board. For the year 2000, the landlord can therefore increase the
rent by 2.9%.

However, there is a significant catch to the matter: Rent control
only applies to buildings constructed before June 1979 (thankfully,
our building is older) and generally only to apartments that are not
used commercially. This means that our corner newsstand cannot hope
for "rent control." Additionally, the landlord is allowed to
accumulate increases, meaning if they do not raise the rent in one
year, they can increase it by not only the percentage valid for the
current year but also add the percentage from the previous year. In
San Francisco, however, a catastrophic situation has arisen from the
fact that the landlord can charge as much as they want when a tenant
moves out. Since the housing market in San Francisco has changed so
dramatically in recent years, it is common for rent increases of
200%-300% or more to occur when a tenant who has lived in the same
apartment for a long time moves out. For example, our neighbor lives
in an apartment that is exactly the same size as ours. She pays $400,
we already pay $1100, and the next person to move in would have to
shell out at least $2000 for the apartment.

This housing policy naturally leads to landlords being interested in
getting long-term tenants with lower rents to move out if possible.
In San Francisco, there are increasing reports of landlords letting
apartments fall into disrepair to force tenants to leave, which was
also very popular in New York in the eighties. In New York, "Rent
Control" is also known -- but that's just a side note. I also know
quite a few people who have had to leave their apartments because the
buildings they lived in were sold and the new owner claimed personal
use. This particularly affects tenants living in the very typical
two-family houses in San Francisco. Sadly, many are forced to move
away from San Francisco. For shops and restaurants, this means that
more and more chains are entering San Francisco's typical
neighborhoods, as only they can afford the high rents. The climate in
the city has changed significantly. Tourists might not notice it as
much, but San Francisco has acquired some ugly scars.

Don't get me wrong, we still think it's one of the most beautiful
cities in the world, but precisely because we love the city so much,
it really hurts to see what's happening right now. Ironically, the
booming internet industry, which should actually promise prosperity
and tax revenue that should benefit a city, is responsible for the
whole misery. The problem is that housing is limited, and more and
more companies want to settle in San Francisco and Silicon Valley.
And company openings also mean employees who need a place to live.
Most internet companies are quite financially strong, so they can
offer their employees good salaries, which in turn allows them to pay
absurdly high rents to secure a part of the much too scarce housing.

The companies, in turn, are now settling in neighborhoods where
artists had found their niche. These are usually unattractive
residential areas with old factory buildings that the artists had
converted into studios and were affordable until now. The problem is
that internet companies are willing to pay much higher rents, thereby
driving the artists out of these neighborhoods. To make you believe
this, here's a small example: My photography teacher, along with
another photographer, had rented a photo studio of about 120 square
meters in an older company building. They paid $2000 in rent per
month. But from now on, the studio will be an office for a computer
company and will cost $12000 in rent per month. This month, the only
two photo labs in San Francisco where you could do your own color
developments also had to close. The rent was increased to the point
where the owners could no longer operate them profitably. All the
renowned photographers of San Francisco developed and enlarged their
own color photos there, as you can't just set up a color darkroom in
your garage or basement.

In the meantime, the first protests are stirring, and citizen groups
are forming to stop the trend--a good sign. Incidentally, "Dotcom"
has now become a derogatory term in San Francisco. Here, "Dotcom"
generally refers to internet companies because they usually have a
".com" in their web address, such as yahoo.com. "Dot" (English for
point) simply means the dot that precedes the "com." A "Dotcommer"
works for an internet company, is a 25-year-old upstart fresh out of
