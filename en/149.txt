<em>Michael</em> On the streets of San Francisco, we're experiencing almost
futuristic scenes recently. Initially skeptically received, but now fully
accepted by the drivers, more and more self-driving cars are mixing into the
dense city traffic.  The first time I came to a stop an intersection next to
one of these cars equipped with conspicuous cameras and glanced over, I
couldn't believe my eyes: the driver's seat was empty and there was nobody else
in the car. When the light turned green, we both drove off, at pretty decent
speed.

I really have to say that these cars drive amazingly well. To that you have
to know that 90% of Californians drive like twelve year olds. I know people
who spent 200,000 dollars on BMWs but can't even parallel park. When you're at
an intersection with four stop signs, there's always someone who's supposed to
go first, but it's quite common that no one does at first, and then everyone starts going at the same time and the honking begins.

I have had several encounters with Google-operated self-driving Waymo cars in
city traffic, and every time I was amazed at how well their driving computer
handled complex situations. Cars from the company Cruise, backed by General
Motors, are also driving around at a similar level. Once I arrived at a 4-way
stop at the same time as a Waymo car, and I thought to myself, "Oho, let's see
what happens now". A second later, the Waymo car cautiously entered the
intersection, just like a human driver who is on the ball would do.

Once I saw that on the opposite lane of a two-lane but not particularly wide
street, a cyclist was coming towards me, behind him a line of cars that didn't
dare to overtake because it was too narrow. I drove a bit further to the right
on my side to make room, and suddenly the Waymo car crossed the center line by
half a meter and overtook the cyclist safely and smoothly. Here, hardly any
driver would have dared to do that, and I was surprised that it was taught to
the driving computer. Hats off!

You can also hire the driverless vehicles as a taxi. Download the app
"Waymo-One" or the competitor's "Cruise" on your phone and then book the ride
like with Uber or Lyft. However, this business is currently only allowed to the
two companies at night. The city of San Francisco has only issued the permit
between 10 pm and 5 am.

It is a bit creepy to get into a driverless car, but friends have told me that
they arrived safely at their destination. Self-driving cars, by the way, take
strange routes through the city. Because it is technically easier to turn right
than left, they do not choose the shortest routes, but those without left
turns. So they take detours that a human driver would probably not choose, but
so far there has been no serious accident. As always, the old-fashioned hippies
in the city are protesting against the innovation, as recently happened when
they appeared in the Mission
district.<LINK>https://twitter.com/TheMarinaTimes/status/1667702963207557121?s=20|A shooting with nine injured in San Francisco's Mission district.</LINK>
There was
a shooting, and a self-driving car stopped and didn't go any further, even when
the ambulance drove through. Left-leaning city councils were more upset about
the car than the shooting! Recently, a Waymo car ran over a dog that had broken
away from its owner and ran out onto the street from behind a car. Well, that
happens, even with human drivers, but when it comes to robot taxis, the
complaining starts. The technology will still come, anyway, and it has my
blessing!
