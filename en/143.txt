@Z: Cave tours in Pinnacles National Park

<pic images/pinnacles-cave-m.ps Fearless newsletter reporters are reporting live from the climbing cave.>

<em>Michael</em> During the time "between the years," at the end of December
2021, we drove two hours south to the small town of San Juan Bautista and from
there took day trips to Pinnacles National Park, which is an hour away from
there.

<pic images/pinnacles-panorama.ps Grandiose scenery in Pinnacles National Park>

At first, with mixed weather and even some rain, there was hardly anyone in the
park, and for two days we went on tours without encountering many people. But
on the last day, the weather forecast suddenly predicted sunshine, and it was
as crowded as Munich's Stachus. Since we arrived only around noon, we weren't
even allowed to park at the trail head. The offered shuttle, with lines
of people waiting at the Visitor Center stop, was too crowded for us, so we
trudged twice three kilometers from the parking lot to the trailhead and back.
Not a walk in the park, and in the summer, I wouldn't even consider visiting
this park, as you probably wouldn't be able to move an inch due to the influx
of day tourists and hordes of climbers.

<pic images/pinnacles-balcony-cave-exit.ps Under the large stone is the cave entrance.>

As the main attraction besides the amazing mountain panorama of Pinnacles
National Park, two hiking trails lead through really deep, winding, and
pitch-dark caves in the mountain. Some parts of these caves are equipped with
steps and are easy to walk through, while other parts have been left in a more
"primitive" state, as the head ranger at the Visitor Center put it. Even in the
well-developed caves, hikers sometimes have to squeeze through narrow crevices
or waddle deep in a crouch under rock overhangs. Definitely not for hikers who
suffer from claustrophobia.

<pic images/pinnacles-balcony-cave.ps Angelika emerges from the Pinnacles-Balconies Cave.>

On the third day, we dared to take the circular route that led through the
"primitive" Balcony Cave. Since it was raining, albeit not heavily but
noticeably at times, some sections of the cave filled with water. We were faced
with the decision to either return the same way or grit our teeth, march
through knee-deep water with our hiking boots, and complete the circular route.
We encountered a family who had carried their children through the flooded
cave, so we knew that although we would get wet, we would make it to the other
side alive. We decided to go for the cold bath.

<pic images/pinnacles-balcony-trail.ps The hiking trail to the cave is not for the faint-hearted.>

We were quite shaken as we waded through several knee-deep flooded cave
passages, and at times, with our waterlogged shoes, had to duck under low
rocks, but we made it to the exit just fine. There, we briefly took off our
shoes, wrung out our soaking wet socks, put everything back on with gritted
teeth, and hiked the remaining five kilometers back to the car on the circular
route. Memories of my time in the military came flooding back!

<pic images/pinnacles-water.ps Due to the rain, parts of the path were underwater.>

By the way, I had brought a rod lamp normally used for car repairs for the
cave, and it was very useful because in the winding cave passages completely
cut off from daylight, you can't see your hand in front of your face. A real
adventure with a good outcome! However, as mentioned, only doable in really bad
weather, because otherwise masses of day tourists turn the popular national
park into a fairground.

@Z: The true American driver's license - "Real ID"

<pic images/real-id-sample.ps Only genuine with the bear seal: The California Real ID.>

<em>Angelika</em> The USA, as is well known, does not have a registration law
or a document like a EU grade identity card.  Nevertheless, one still needs to
identify oneself. This is usually done with a driver's license, which is not
only needed for driving a car but also to prove that you are indeed who you
claim to be.  And for those of you who are particularly attentive readers and
are now wondering: what do the poor people who never learned to drive, who
surprisingly also exist in the USA, do about that? Here is the solution to the
puzzle: There is the option to apply for a driver's license that only serves as
an ID, but does not grant driving privileges.

In the United States, the issuance of driver's licenses falls under the
jurisdiction of individual states. Until now, they had considerable freedom
regarding the appearance of the document, and the requirements on which
documents needed to be presented to obtain a driver's license. There were no
uniform rules or security regulations that applied to all states. However,
within the United States, a driver's license is sufficient, for example, to
board a plane. So, when we flew to Hawaii every year before the pandemic, we
only carried our regular California driver's license every time, and no
passport as identification in our luggage.

This is about to change soon. Starting May 3, 2023, every air traveler will
need a driver's license with standardized security features, the so-called
"Real ID," to fly within the USA. "Real ID" roughly translates to "Real
Identification Document." Of course, anyone with a valid passport can also
board a flight. However, only 42% of Americans possess a passport, with the
rest having never traveled outside of the country. Years ago, this number was
even lower.

<pic images/dmv-round.ps The DMV issues Real IDs.>

The name "Real ID" is derived from the corresponding law, namely the "Real ID
Act," which was passed by the American Congress back in 2005. Yes, you read
that correctly, the law is a whopping 17 years old, a truly complicated birth.
After the attacks on September 11, 2001, in which some of the terrorists
boarded the later hijacked planes with regular American driver's licenses that
they should not have been able to obtain, the 9/11 Commission recommended
tightening and standardizing the requirements for obtaining a driver's license
in the various states. This led to the aforementioned law in 2005, which,
however, received a lot of criticism from both conservative and liberal camps.
Many argued that a national identification document was being introduced
through the back door, which is an absolute red flag for many Americans. As a
result, some states initially refused to implement the new requirements, and
the introduction of the "Real ID" was repeatedly postponed: from 2008 to 2009,
then from 2011 to 2013, and finally to October 2020.

Before the deadline in October 2020, the big race to obtain Real IDs had
already begun many months earlier, at least here in California. This was
because when applying for a "Real ID" for the first time, one must appear in
person at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), which led to a situation
where there were no more appointments available and complete chaos ensued at
one of the most unpopular agencies in America. Although the DMV now presents
itself as modern, and many things can be done through the online portal, I
often found myself pulling my hair out because it was extremely cumbersome to
get the right form, which needed to be filled out online before the in-person
appointment at the DMV to speed up the process. Allegedly, the applicant could
also upload their documents, but neither Michael nor I managed to do so, and
thus the DMV employee scanned the documents during our appointments. I must confess
that I fervently hope hackers do not get the idea to steal data from the DMV,
as I have somewhat lost confidence that digital security is ensured there. By
the way, I received my first "Real ID" in December 2019. Michael got his a few
months later, as the pandemic was gaining momentum. Corona was also the reason
the deadline was postponed again, from October 2020 to now May 2023.

What uniform regulations now apply to obtain a "Real ID"? Everyone must first
present an official document that confirms their legal name and date of birth,
such as a birth certificate, a passport (American or issued by another
country), or a naturalization certificate. Additionally, one needs an American
Social Security Number, as well as two documents that contain the residential
address plus the name (for example, utility bills, insurance contracts, rental
agreements, bank statements). Furthermore, it is necessary to prove that one is
legally residing in the country, which the applicant can demonstrate, for
example, by presenting a Green Card. In California, Green Card holders and
residents with work or student visas can obtain a "Real ID." However, the "Real
ID" is only valid as long as the visa or Green Card is valid. A few states
(e.g., Washington) only issue the "Real ID" to American citizens. In
Washington, this is because it borders Canada, and the driver's license also
serves as an ID for crossing the border into Canada, which entails even
stricter regulations.

<pic images/dmv-entrance.ps Entrance to the Department of Motor Vehicles>

The "Real ID" can be recognized by the star in the upper right corner of the
driver's license. In California, this star is part of the California bear that
also adorns the California flag. By the way, you still do not need a "Real ID"
to drive a car in California; the old standard version, which can still be
applied for, is sufficient. However, starting in May 2023, you will no longer
be able to use it to board a plane or enter buildings like courthouses. This
standard driver's license does not have a star in the upper right corner;
instead, it says "Federal Limits Apply" in California. Thus, immigrants without
valid papers can still obtain a California driver's license as a driving
permit, which has been allowed since 2013 by Governor Jerry Brown. The
California "Real ID" also has features built in to prevent counterfeiting, in
addition to the star and the bear.

All "Real IDs" must be machine-readable. On the Californian one, the date of
birth is embossed on the photo, so the numbers are slightly raised. The same
applies to the signature. When you illuminate the Californian "Real ID" with
ultraviolet light, the Golden Gate Bridge and the Coit Tower, which is also
located in San Francisco, appear. However, you cannot see these landmarks with
the naked eye, which I find a bit unfortunate. Now we are curious to see if the
deadline in May next year will finally be met.

@Z: Ukraine in America

<pic images/ujump.ps Michael has nonsense on his mind as usual.>

<em>Angelika</em> Sometimes I think that the world has gone completely crazy.
After we were able to catch our breath a bit regarding COVID-19, the war of
aggression in Ukraine is once again plunging the world into fear and terror.
There is often the prejudice that Americans are hardly affected by foreign
events that are far away, but here too, the war in Ukraine is a constant topic
of conversation. Of course, this is also because the USA is directly involved,
taking in Ukrainian refugees, albeit in small numbers, and providing money and
weapons.

<pic images/ukraine-stairs.ps A resident of our neighborhood has raised the Ukrainian flag in solidarity.>

Secretary of State Blinken and Secretary of Defense Austin have already
traveled to Ukraine to meet with President Zelensky. Last week, Nancy Pelosi,
who holds the third-highest position in the country (after the President and
Vice President) as Speaker of the House of Representatives, made her way to
Ukraine. In our neighborhood, we see many Ukrainian flags fluttering in the
wind and peace doves in the windows, which likely also reflect a sense of
helplessness, as these symbols have little influence on the course of the war.

In school, we always try to discuss current news with our students. We often
use videos from the
website <LINK>https://www.flocabulary.com/topics/week-in-rap|Flocabulary</LINK>.
The word is a portmanteau of "flow" and "vocabulary." It refers to an
educational platform that uses hip-hop music and rhythm to teach vocabulary and
other academic content. It brings current political events closer to students
in an age-appropriate manner through hip-hop style. Every week, there is the
so-called "Week in Rap" recap. The children in my class find these videos very
appealing. I remember that during my school days, it always annoyed me terribly
when current events were swept under the rug, and instead, we focused on the
ancient Romans and Greeks. One of my students was immediately concerned about
my family because, after watching the videos, she correctly noted that Ukraine
is not that far from Germany.

<pic images/ukraine-window.ps This neighbor supports Ukraine, among other things.>

Then, of course, there are various experts here who try to understand the
situation in Ukraine. I particularly appreciate Masha Gessen, who writes for
the New Yorker, grew up in Moscow, and emigrated to the USA with her family as
a teenager. Gessen has written several books, including some about Putin. I can
also highly recommend the journalist and historian Anne Applebaum, who writes
for the magazine "Atlantic." One of her most well-known books is "Red Famine:
Stalin's War on Ukraine.

But in the past few weeks, a conversation has been running through my mind that
I had over 20 years ago with a photography teacher in the darkroom of the UC
Berkeley Extension. Putin had just been elected president, and I asked the
teacher what he thought of it, as I knew he originally came from St.
Petersburg. His face darkened, and he simply said that he couldn't understand
how this criminal had been elevated to office. He told me that he and his
family had been persecuted and threatened by the KGB at the time because, as a
photographer, he had taken pictures of people on the streets of St. Petersburg.
Many of his film negatives were destroyed. The photos weren't even very political,
but rather snapshots of a city. How I would love to talk to him again now about
the current situation.

@Z: Cat theft in broad daylight

<pic images/cat-theft-daylight.ps (#1) In broad daylight, these individuals saw the catalytic converter off a car.>

<em>Michael</em> As mentioned in the last <RBLINK>20211222#3</RBLINK>, it is now
normal here in San Francisco for petty crime to no longer be pursued by the
police and the district attorney. Recently, thieves have been crawling under
parked cars in broad daylight, using battery-powered saw to tools cut off the
catalytic converter, and selling the part along with the precious metals it
contains to shady scrap dealers. The photo in illustration (#1) was taken by a
resident who noticed the activity; however, despite an immediate emergency
call, the police only arrived hours later, by which time the thieves were long
gone. In such cases, the car owners affected have to pay several thousand
dollars for a new catalytic converter, depending on the vehicle type, plus an
equal amount to repair the damage caused to the exhaust system by the rough
sawing. It costs an additional $400 if the owner hires a workshop to weld a
specially designed steel cage around the catalytic converter to prevent another
criminal from stealing the replaced converter using the same method a week
later.

<pic images/cat-theft-report.ps Citizens report the theft online, but no one takes care of it.>

The thieves know that the police here in San Francisco have by now given up
patrolling the streets, and should they happen to arrest wrongdoers by chance,
our criminal-friendly district attorney Boudin won't press charges and,
following his broken political ideology, immediately releases them, because no
people were injured during the crime.

A new catalytic converter costs between $1,000 and $3,000 depending on the car
brand, and including labor hours, a victim, or their insurance coverage,
can quickly end up paying $4,000 to $5,000 for the repair. It is
suspected that some workshops partially buy back the stolen catalytic
converters through dubious channels and sell them to unsuspecting customers.
The thieves only get a fraction of the original price for a stolen catalytic
converter from shady scrap dealers. But earning a few hundred dollars with five
minutes of work, without the risk of being held accountable for illegal
activities, is incentive enough for an increasing number of criminals. That it
would come to the point where things would be like in the post-apocalyptic film
"Mad Max" here, no one would have dreamed of ten years ago. You never stop
learning.

@Z: Corona Update

<pic images/mask-produce.ps Most customers in the stores are still wearing masks.>

<em>Angelika</em> This week, our chief expert on infectious diseases, Dr.
Anthony Fauci, announced that we in the USA have moved past the acute phase of
the pandemic. Let's hope it stays that way. After the holidays in December, the
Omicron variant hit us with full force in San Francisco and the surrounding
area. At the school, this resulted in a very high rate of employee sick leave in
January, and we maintained school operations with extremely limited staff.
Although the quarantine period is now only 5 days if you test positive and are
vaccinated, we were still at our wits' end.

<pic images/walgreens-masks.ps At the drugstore Walgreens, wearing a mask is now only recommended.>

We are a very small school and work with challenging children. Even when one
staff member is absent, we feel it significantly. I also felt as if I had a
test swab permanently in my nose because I was always in close contact with
positive individuals. Miraculously, I did not get infected. I have no idea why.
Maybe my strict adherence to wearing an FFP2 mask helped. The Omicron wave has
now subsided, but as is the case with waves, the next one will surely come
soon, especially since the mask mandate has been lifted in San Francisco and at
our school. We only have to wear masks in a few exceptions, namely in doctor's
offices, hospitals, nursing homes, homeless shelters, and prisons.

Of course, everyone can still voluntarily wear a mask, and here in San
Francisco, you see only a few people without a mask in stores. I also still
wear a mask most of the time at school, even though almost none of the students
and staff do anymore. Until recently, we were also required to wear a mask on
public transportation. Now the situation is a bit more complicated, after a
federal judge in Florida lifted the national mask mandate for transportation,
such as buses, subways, and airplanes in the USA about two weeks ago. Now,
individual municipalities or transportation companies themselves determine what
applies to their transportation system. In San Francisco, this has led to the
absurdity that masks are mandatory on BART (the subway in San Francisco), but
not on buses and streetcars, because Muni, a different transportation company,
is responsible for those.

TODO

<pic images/muni-streetcar.ps In the Muni streetcar, you are allowed to ride without a mask.>

In the meantime, many tech companies in Silicon Valley have also ordered their
employees back to the office from home, which is noticeably reflected in the
increasing traffic. Michael, too, had to return to the office after more than
two years. However, this is happening gradually for him. Initially, he had to
work one day at the company in mid-April. By now, he has reached two days, and
in the next phase, this will increase to three days. Since most employees enjoy
working from home, it will still be allowed for two days a week. Naturally,
Michael grumbled a bit when he had to go back, because for him, working from
home is the ultimate, and he could have continued like that indefinitely.

@Z: Ooni Pizzaofen" translates to "Ooni pizza oven" in English.

<pic images/ooni-oven.ps The gas-powered Ooni oven in action on the balcony.>

<em>Michael</em> As you may remember, in the last newsletter I talked about
special utensils for making top-quality pizza at home, and I casually mentioned
the gas-powered mini oven from Ooni. And just like that, Angelika gave me one
of these for Christmas. It was supposed to be a surprise. However, Angelika
didn't consider that the residents of our apartment building are now as
vigilant as hawks to ensure delivered packages aren't immediately stolen. As
soon as the delivery service placed the huge box in the lobby downstairs, it
took less than five minutes for our neighbor to send me a text message: "Hey, a
pizza oven for Angelika was just delivered downstairs!" I was still happy.

<pic images/ooni-pizza.ps The pizza from the Ooni oven is restaurant quality.>

After Christmas, I immediately connected the device to the propane tank of our
grill on the balcony, turned it on full blast for half an hour until the
infrared thermometer from my tool collection showed 750F (400 degrees Celsius),
and then slid a hand-shaped, ultra-thin pizza topped with mozzarella, Don
Peppino tomato sauce, onions, and anchovies into the opening onto the ceramic
plate inside the oven using a large spatula. After 30 seconds, you need to take
the pizza out with the spatula, quickly turn it, and put it back in for another
30 seconds, then it's done. It tasted great! Only the high temperature of the
pizza oven creates that typical pizzeria flavor, which is completely different
from a pizza baked in a home oven. You just have to be careful that the dough
doesn't burn at these high temperatures or set the house on fire, but by now
I've gathered enough experience handling a sticky, thin layer of dough in
dangerous devices under extreme temperatures. Top product!

@Z: Sliding with a potato sack

<pic images/esmeralda-slide.ps With a potato sack underneath, the slide in Bernal Heights is even usable.>

<em>Michael</em> In San Francisco, a well-kept secret is a staircase in the
hilly neighborhood of Bernal Heights called the "Esmeralda Stairs," which is
surely a hundred meters long and has a slide built between two landings. No
kidding, the slide is ten meters long and is constructed so sturdily from steel
that, after a thorough inspection, I concluded that it can not only withstand
the boisterous children it was built for but also adults of my size. Now, I
have never seen anyone older than 10 years sliding there, but that doesn't mean
anything.

<pic images/burlap-ebay.ps For 4 sacks of potatoes, Michael paid a mere 16 dollars on eBay.>

In my first few attempts at sliding, however, it turned out that the steel
slide, despite its polished surface, created too much friction with the cotton
fabric of my pants. Instead of accelerating into a rapid descent, I immediately
came to a halt and even had to push myself to avoid getting stuck. Back home, I
remembered that as children in Augsburg's Ziegelstadel amusement park, we
always zoomed down the giant slide on potato sacks. But since nowadays, as an
urban resident of an American city, one no longer has potato sacks on hand, I
quickly ordered a four-pack of so-called "burlap sacks," as they are called in
English, on eBay.

<pic images/esmeralda-map.ps Location of the Esmeralda Slide in the Bernal Heights neighborhood.>

After the package with the order finally arrived, we set out for Bernal Heights
on a Sunday morning, made sure there were no children nearby, and then
proceeded with the death-defying execution of the experiment. To be honest, I
wasn't entirely sure how strongly the frictionless acceleration would catapult
me downward, so I kept my jacket on as a precaution to prevent abrasions.
Additionally, I am known to have cat-like reflexes due to my many years of
martial arts experience! However, Angelika feared that I would end up in the
emergency room, but after some persuasion, she agreed to go
<LINK>https://youtu.be/nUgLiZkIWI0|film|Slide video on YouTube</LINK>
the whole thing. And, behold, I went swiftly downwards, just fast enough!
Angelika also dared to take the ride afterwards, and both newsletter reporters survived
the experiment without injuries!

@Z: Finally understandable: Democratic, liberal, and progressive

<pic images/tenderloin-pants.ps Liberal" Lifestyle in San Francisco's Tenderloin>

<em>Michael</em> When it comes to political ideologies, Americans use terms that
often mean the exact opposite of what their literal translation into German
would imply, and that's why today I'm going to shed some light on this. First,
the two-party system: you are either a "Democrat" or a "Republican." There is
no "Green," "Liberal," "Leftist," or AfD member; 99% of all ideologies find
their home in one of these two groups.

The translation into "Democrats" and "Republicans" is problematic in itself
because both parties are democratic, and comparing the "Republicans" with the
right-wing party "Die Republikaner," which became popular in Germany in the
1980s, is not accurate. But let's leave it at that for now. Additionally, there
are, of course, nuances within these two unified parties. For example, the
current President Biden is more center-right among the Democrats, while
Socialist Sanders is far left. This leads to Biden being constantly criticized
by young radicals within his own party for not being radical enough. Among the
Republicans, John McCain was once one of the moderates, and former President
Trump was far right. Since Obama (a Democratic president) and especially since
Trump (a Republican president), it has become difficult to find moderate
Republicans, as the party has become highly radicalized. This mutual
radicalization of both parties has resulted in virtually no cooperation between
Democrats and Republicans nowadays. When one side proposes something, the other
side reflexively torpedoes it.

<pic images/blmdtp.ps Progressive" household in Noe Valley.>

An American "Democrat" is politically roughly aligned with the SPD: They
support labor unions, want to heavily tax the rich, assist low-income earners
with state funds, enforce a weapons ban, and generally believe that the state
should take matters into its own hands and steer through active legislation.
"Democrats" are not tired of claiming that all "Republicans" are backward
idiots (almost all states in the middle of the USA, i.e., away from the coastal
regions, are in Republican hands) and want the Electoral College (the
complicated American electoral system, in which states appoint electors, giving
smaller states more influence than purely by voter numbers) to be abolished.
This would guarantee Democratic presidents for decades.

A "Republican," on the other hand, is positioned somewhat to the right of the CDU (Christian Democratic Union), economically close to the FDP (Free Democratic Party), meaning they are employer-friendly. They prefer to levy as few taxes as possible, as the state should operate a lean apparatus that only intervenes in the free market in exceptional cases. Weapons remain permitted, as intended by the Constitution. Republicans point fingers at mega-cities in the USA, such as New York City, Chicago, or Los Angeles, all of which are in Democratic hands and struggle with high crime rates, unemployment, and general societal decay. Since Democratic voters outnumber Republicans because the densely populated coastal states are almost all governed by Democrats, the complicated electoral system should remain.

Now, let's talk about "liberal." In Germany, when someone says "liberal," they
automatically mean the FDP, because that's the liberal party, in the sense of
"individual freedom" and "let the economy do its thing." In America, it means
pretty much the opposite; a "liberal" is a person who doesn't interfere when
other people do questionable things. For example, if someone reports on an
online portal that their house was broken into and their laptop was stolen,
there's always a "liberal" who feels sympathy for the poor burglar who
apparently can't afford their own laptop. I know "liberals" who are so extreme
that they specialize in finding excuses and never tire of explaining why it's
okay for lawbreakers to break the law. They get very creative with it and raise
their children to be unruly individuals without setting any boundaries. This
certainly doesn't apply to all, but the tendency is there.

A "Progressive" is essentially a subset of a "Liberal," as the "Progressive"
wants to radically change things, operating under the mantra that the state and
police have done everything wrong so far and that it's time for a new approach.
This generally means that the state should no longer interfere with policing or
punishment, as such actions only lead to discord, anger, and unpleasant
situations. The Progressive does not see that the absence of state pressure on
wrongdoers could potentially lead to more crime. The idea that distributing
money indiscriminately diminishes people's motivation to take care of
themselves is unknown to them. They are indifferent to the fact that their
extreme political programs alienate ordinary voters, who ultimately foot the
bill with their taxes. According to the "Progressives," the pronounced social
differences in America are the root of all evil.

Ironically, "progressives" in San Francisco have often become wealthy citizens
due to the real estate bubble, having risen from being hippies. This brings me
to the term "Champagne Socialist." This is someone who (supposedly) advocates
for the common man and the public school system but sends their own children to
private school because they want them to get a good education. Our governor,
Gavin Newsom, is one such person, and in the hippie neighborhood of Bernal
Heights, practically all the residents are like that. Well, now you know, in
case you come across this term again!

Greetings from San Francisco:

Angelika and Michael
