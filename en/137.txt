@Z: Christmas 2020

<em>Angelika</em> A challenging and very unusual year is coming to an end. In a
year with so many challenges, we all long for a bit of normalcy. That's why,
even in 2020, my Christmas newsletter can't be missed. More than ever, this
year was marked by statistics. Newspapers and news broadcasts constantly showed
us infection rates and the number of COVID deaths. In San Francisco and the
surrounding area, it's now often about the remaining number of ICU beds.
Statistics are often dry numbers, but behind them lie stories and the signs of
the times. The following small personal statistics show a bit of how we spent
the year. We hope that next year will look different again.
