Hello, loved ones!

<em>Angelika</em> Now that I've crawled out of my darkroom (my
photography course is finished), you're finally hearing from me again. As
Michael already reported in his last newsletter, the photography course
inspired me so much that I spent hours and hours in the darkroom and had no time for
anything else. Of course, I immediately registered for a follow-up course. In
the coming semester, I will be taking two more courses as part of the certificate
program "Children and the Changing Family". These courses are mandatory; if I
successfully complete them, I will have a certificate in my pocket. Hurray!!!

@Z: Social work in the Tenderloin

Many people have recently asked what's going on with my work in the "Tenderloin
Childcare Center". I'm still going twice a week, often even three times, when
additional help is needed for trips or parties. I have been doing this for
exactly one year so far.

The graduation ceremony with diploma
award for the children in my group was celebrated in mid-August. "Graduation"
because all the children in my group are moving on to kindergarten. Maybe you
are wondering now: "Why kindergarten, we thought they were already in
kindergarten?" You've got to know that although the German word "Kindergarten" is
used in America, something completely different is meant by it. In Germany, we
usually refer to the time from three years old to school entry as "Kindergarten
time". Most children go to the same facility during this time, their
kindergarten. In America, only the last year before school is referred to as
"kindergarten".

Most kindergarten classes are already in the building of the elementary school.
In America, kids usually enter school at 6 years of age. It is a common
practice for kindergarten children to learn letters, numbers, etc. All
facilities that the children visit before this American kindergarten time are
either referred to as "Preschool" ("Preschool") or generally as "Childcare
Center" or "Day Care Center".  Confused? Don't worry, it took me quite a while
to understand the differences.

Now you may be wondering why there is a graduation ceremony with diploma award
for such small children. Are Americans totally crazy? Now to their honor,
it should be said that normally such "graduation parties" only take place after
successful completion of high school, college or university. These are then the
typical parties that are often seen in American television programs. Each
graduate has a gown in the colors of the school or university and a doctor's
hat in the same color. Speeches are held, parents and other relatives sit with
teary eyes in the audience and finally each graduate is called to the stage and
his or her diploma is ceremoniously presented.

That's how the party went in the
Tenderloin as well. The children had red robes and a red doctor's hat and got a
certificate stating that they had successfully completed preschool. The
question remains why such a fuss for such small children, couldn't there have
been a nice graduation party from which the children themselves might have benefitted
more? Many facilities like the "Tenderloin Childcare Center", for which I volunteer, now hold such
highly official "graduation parties" because they say that most parents are
dropouts and have never experienced their own party. Therefore, they should
experience the positive experience of a "graduation" as often as possible
through their children. I still have mixed feelings about this thought and
can't really decide how I feel about this idea. It was interesting anyway.

It was funny that each of us volunteers also received
a certificate (although we had no robes). Chris (also a volunteer) and I were named
the "volunteers of the year" due to our special commitment and engagement for
the institution. We both received a book gift voucher and were particularly
highlighted at the celebration, which honestly made me very happy. Maybe there
is something to these celebrations after all.

I am still working with the older children (on average 4-5 years old) in the
same group room now. I already know most of the children because they simply
moved up from the neighboring group. The educator teams have also been newly
composed for various reasons.  Samantha, with whom I get along particularly
well, is fortunately still in the group I come to volunteer in.

@Z: Short break in Shelter Cove.

<em>Angelika</em>
Last weekend we had a holiday here, the so-called "Labor Day"
("Day of Work"), on which Michael also had a day off. So we immediately rented a car
to take advantage of the extended weekend. We drove to the "Lost Coast". 
As the name suggests, this is not exactly the coastal section where
the crowds gather and that's why we went there. The "Lost Coast" is located in
the far north of California. That's where they couldn't build Highway 1 (Coast
Dream Road) back then because the terrain was too rugged and the weather
conditions too harsh. Fortunately, later, when technically there was nothing in
the way of building the road, there were already nature conservationists who
knew how to prevent it.

The only larger place on this stretch of coast with the
name "Shelter Cove" can only be reached via a 25-mile very winding (it goes
over the mountains) road with quite a few potholes, which takes about an hour
(turbo drivers and mountain rat Michael of course managed it a bit faster).
Arriving in Shelter Cove you feel immediately like in a completely different,
very un-American world: No McDonalds, no bank, no gas station, the locals
with their sun-tanned skin all look like fishermen and you have the impression
that everyone meets in the evening in the only pub of the place, where nobody
cares that smoking in pubs has been banned in California since the beginning of
the year.

As I said, this place is close to the end of the world, where its own laws apply
(GÃ¼nter, for old smokers like you this would have been paradise). In front of the
pub, the fishermen take out the freshly caught fish and above them the seagulls
circle and make a deafening noise. All around, the ocean rages as far as the eye
can see, there are vast cliffs and a long beach with black sand, which is quite unique for California
and has led me to torment myself with the question all weekend why the sand
suddenly turns black, one of those questions that can be approached both
scientifically and philosophically. Well, I couldn't answer this question
satisfactorily, but you can see that the landscape invited to stare at the sea
and ponder for hours.

It would have all been wonderful, had the pitfalls of civilization not caught
up with us on our arrival day. Our rental car had a flat tire, there was a nail
in it, and it was hissing terribly, and in no time the tire was flat. Of
course, it's clear that such misfortune only happens when you're at the end of
the world without a gas station or auto repair shop, and it's a holy holiday in
America, and the car insurance doesn't cover tire damage. Fortunately, Ed's Gas
Station (long live the American service economy) had mercy on us. After we put
on the spare tire, a spare wheel that was much smaller than the actual tire,
and drove the 25 miles over the hill to the nearest town (this time slowly and
decently), Ed himself patched the tire. Ed could have also played a gangster in
a John Wayne western, the cigarette (remember, we're at a gas station where
smoking is strictly forbidden due to the risk of explosion!) casually in the
corner of his mouth, he quickly repaired the tire and only charged us 12
dollars (surely in cash) and saved our weekend.

Next weekend we'll be going on another trip. Michael was finally able to take a
week off, eating into his 14-day annual vacation grant (you remember, previously he had a vacation stop
due to a project) and we'll be heading to Hawaii. This time we are going to the
island of "Molokai", which is said to be the least touristy and most original.
We will report back in the next newsletter to tell you how it was!
