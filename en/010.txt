Hello, loved ones!

<em>Angelika</em> Now that I've crawled out of my darkroom (my
photography course is finished), you're finally hearing from me again. As
Michael already reported in his last newsletter, the photography course
inspired me so much that I spent hours and hours in the darkroom and had no time for
anything else. Of course, I immediately registered for a follow-up course. In
the coming semester, I will be taking two more courses as part of the certificate
program "Children and the Changing Family". These courses are mandatory; if I
successfully complete them, I will have a certificate in my pocket. Hurray!!!

@Z: Social work in the Tenderloin

Many people have recently asked what's going on with my work in the "Tenderloin
Childcare Center". I'm still going twice a week, often even three times, when
additional help is needed for trips or parties. I have been doing this for
exactly one year so far.

The graduation ceremony with diploma
award for the children in my group was celebrated in mid-August. "Graduation"
because all the children in my group are moving on to kindergarten. Maybe you
are wondering now: "Why kindergarten, we thought they were already in
kindergarten?" You've got to know that although the German word "Kindergarten" is
used in America, something completely different is meant by it. In Germany, we
usually refer to the time from three years old to school entry as "Kindergarten
time". Most children go to the same facility during this time, their
kindergarten. In America, only the last year before school is referred to as
"kindergarten".

Most kindergarten classes are already in the building of the elementary school.
In America, kids usually enter school at 6 years of age. It is a common
practice for kindergarten children to learn letters, numbers, etc. All
facilities that the children visit before this American kindergarten time are
either referred to as "Preschool" ("Preschool") or generally as "Childcare
Center" or "Day Care Center".  Confused? Don't worry, it took me quite a while
to understand the differences.

Now you may be wondering why there is a graduation ceremony with diploma award
for such small children. Are Americans totally crazy? Now to their honor,
it should be said that normally such "graduation parties" only take place after
successful completion of high school, college or university. These are then the
typical parties that are often seen in American television programs. Each
graduate has a gown in the colors of the school or university and a doctor's
hat in the same color. Speeches are held, parents and other relatives sit with
teary eyes in the audience and finally each graduate is called to the stage and
his or her diploma is ceremoniously presented.

That's how the party went in the
Tenderloin as well. The children had red robes and a red doctor's hat and got a
certificate stating that they had successfully completed preschool. The
question remains why such a fuss for such small children, couldn't there have
been a nice graduation party from which the children themselves might have benefitted
more? Many facilities like the "Tenderloin Childcare Center", for which I volunteer, now hold such
highly official "graduation parties" because they say that most parents are
dropouts and have never experienced their own party. Therefore, they should
experience the positive experience of a "graduation" as often as possible
through their children. I still have mixed feelings about this thought and
can't really decide how I feel about this idea. It was interesting anyway.

It was funny that each of us volunteers also received
a certificate (although we had no robes). Chris (also a volunteer) and I were named
the "volunteers of the year" due to our special commitment and engagement for
the institution. We both received a book gift voucher and were particularly
highlighted at the celebration, which honestly made me very happy. Maybe there
is something to these celebrations after all.

I am still working with the older children (on average 4-5 years old) in the
same group room now. I already know most of the children because they simply
moved up from the neighboring group. The educator teams have also been newly
composed for various reasons.  Samantha, with whom I get along particularly
well, is fortunately still in the group I come to volunteer in.
