@Z: Parachuting out of an airplane

<pic images/sdj3.ps (#1) The intrepid newsletter reporter risks life and limb for a good story.>

<em>Michael</em> 
In search of ever new, more exciting newsletter topics, your intrepid
reporter Michael sometimes has to take unconventional paths. To stay
at the top in the cutthroat news business, it's not enough to keep
churning out the same funny stories; every now and then, you need a
real blockbuster: Drumroll... Ladies and gentlemen... Three... Two...
One... the bomb drops... ka-booooom!: I jumped out of an airplane
from a height of 15,000 feet with a parachute. And here's how it
happened: A friend at Netscape told me about the so-called tandem
jumps, which are currently all the rage in the USA. You get strapped
to an experienced skydiver, fly in a small plane to dizzying heights,
jump out, and race towards the earth in free fall for 60 seconds
before the skydiver pulls the cord and the parachute opens, allowing
you to leisurely glide back to the starting point.

And so it happened: On a Saturday, we drove up to Davis near
Sacramento, where "in the middle of nowhere" at the end of a road
called "29a" lies a small airfield--within a 50 mile radius, there are
only sugar and cornfields. We registered, attended an hour-long
course on the most important safety regulations, and had to sign
about 15 different documents, assuring that we would not sue the
parachute company if something went wrong during the jump.

Then we were put into overalls, a parachutist named "Zach" introduced himself
to me, and like astronauts heading to the Space Shuttle, we walked across the
tarmac to a small propeller plane waiting there, which we squeezed into. The
plane took a short run-up, took off, and spiraled upwards. After about 20
minutes, we reached an altitude of 15,000 feet, and it was time to go! A hatch
was opened, and an icy wind rushed in, the experienced parachutists laughed
their heads off when we said we were, uh, slightly unsettled.

My jumper tightened the straps that I was fastened to him with, and we hobbled
forward to the hatch. I went, as we had discussed beforehand, up to the edge so
that my toes slightly protruded over it, looked down--and I tell you, my dear
ones: In front of me was nothing but an abyss, and down below was ...
California.  Meanwhile, Zach grabbed bar above the hatch with his hands, I
crossed my arms over my chest, he counted "One ... Two ... Three !!!!" and I
let myself tumble forward.  The adrenaline rush that surged through my brain
was incredible as we fell and fell and accelerated to about 120 miles per hour
within a few seconds (Figure (#1)).

I fell forward, horizontally, with my belly towards the ground, Zach was
strapped above me. Once we stabilized in free fall, he signaled to me with a
"thumbs up" that I could extend my arms (Figure (#2)).

<pic images/sdf1.ps ... for 60 seconds!>

The cameraman, another skydiver with a video camera mounted on his helmet, had
jumped right after us and was now circling around us to take some snapshots. It
felt completely surreal: after the acceleration phase, you fall at a constant
speed and feel completely weightless. It’s as if you’re floating in space,
except you feel the wind and hear the roaring sound. This lasted for 60
seconds. The Earth slowly came closer, and I just looked around in amazement,
unable to comprehend it.

Suddenly, there was another signal, and Zach opened the parachute, abruptly
slowing us down from 120 mph to about 20 mph. It felt as if someone had
yanked us upward by a string, and everything suddenly went silent. We could
talk again. Zach handed me the straps of the parachute, and I got to pull them
to the left and right to steer and get a sense of how the landing would go.
Pulling both straps simultaneously slows you down, almost like hovering in
midair. 

We discussed what I needed to keep in mind for the landing: stretch my legs
forward, pull the straps, and land on my rear. And that’s exactly how it went.
After several minutes of gliding, we arrived safely back on Earth (Figure (#3))).

<pic images/sdg2.ps (#3) The Soft Landing>

I was still utterly confused, in the video that I was allowed to
take home, you can see a landing Michael, the man behind the camera
asks, "Mike, what do you think?" and the main character says -- ...
-- nothing at all. A few seconds pause, then gesticulating wildly:
"Amazing!". Don't try this at home, kids. We are trained
professionals.

@Z: News from the Darkroom

<pic images/retusch.ps (#5) Photographer Angelika retouching.>

<em>Michael</em> 
Angelika is meanwhile diligently working on her photos. Figure (#5)
shows the artist retouching the images, where even the last specks of
dust that sneaked onto the negatives and photo paper during
development are covered with matching color. Of course, the old
overachiever received an "A+" in her photography course again. When I
was in school, I also got straight A's, as you know. Haha, or not! And in the
photo lab at the UC Berkeley Extension, the lady has made herself so
indispensable that at the end of the semester, she received a call
from the manager asking if she would like to take on the "Monitor"
(tutor) job one day a week, to assist the students with advice and
support, and to ensure order and discipline (the whip cracks:
Pchtsch! Pchtsch!). As compensation, she is allowed to choose a
course at the university and hang out at the photo lab as often as
she wants, even when it is officially closed to the public, like
during the holidays. I already know who will take full advantage of
that until the very end.

<pic images/bb.ps (#6) Original ... Forgery from the last newsletter ...  and an even more brazen forgery!!>

The prize puzzle last time really gave you a hard time. Dear people, it seems
you are greatly overestimating my athletic abilities. While I can easily fall a
few thousand meters from the sky, I certainly can't jump up five feet high to
reach the basketball hoop--am I Magic Johnson or what? Figure (#6) shows the
original image that a colleague took at Netscape, the fake version from the
last newsletter, and another version where perhaps more people would have
caught on. But after a few days of anxious waiting and a series of incorrect
attempts (most guessed the Austin Powers image with the crooked teeth was
fake), an email with the correct solution arrived: Mother and Bernd Schünke,
who noticed the error due to the incorrect shadow in the image, sent in their
suspicion via email and won! Congratulations and enjoy the hand-signed artwork!

@Z: New at Netscape

<pic images/ns2.ps (#7) The beverage refrigerator at Netscape -- please help yourself, everything is free!>

<em>Michael</em> 
Recently, I was walking through the cubicle rows at Netscape again to
make myself a cappuccino in the kitchen. There's a professional
espresso machine there that not only creates a top-notch "crema" but
also has an endless steam wand for frothing milk, hiss, hiss. On one
of my first days at work, I had to have a colleague explain how to
use it, but by now I could easily serve at the counter in a cafe.

By the way, the drinks at Netscape are free and available in unlimited
quantities, in line with an ancient hacker tradition, which,
incidentally, the now infamous giant "Microsoft" started: In the
kitchen, there's a huge refrigerator like in a supermarket, with
hundreds of drink cans (Figure (#7)); maybe 15 types of "Coke," "Pepsi,"
all the associated diet, caffeine-free, and other combinations, as
well as more exotic things like "Welch's Lemonade" and "Fruit Punch"
-- there's something for every taste. The absolute in-drink in hacker
circles at the moment is "Mountain Dew," a neon green shimmering
caffeinated soda -- just an insider tip.

As I was once again strolling through the rows, I noticed that something had
changed in one of the cubicles. There, a blue and white flag with the state
coat of arms and the inscription "Free State of Bavaria" was prominently
displayed (Figure (#8)). What on earth was going on there?!  I looked into the
cubicle and addressed the gentleman sitting there in English, asking if he knew
that I also came from this region in Germany.  Immediately, in a strong
Bavarian dialect, he responded, asking if I spoke German. It turned out that
"Dieter" was from Rosenheim near Munich, had been living in the USA for twenty
years, and was married to an American. He spoke in the original dialect, and we
chatted for half an hour until Chris (my boss) came by and reminded me that I
was supposed to be in a meeting, haha!

<pic images/ns4.ps (#8) Another Bavarian at Netscape.>

In closing, here's an internal announcement of the newsletter
editorial team: After the Süddeutsche Zeitung and the computer magazine iX, for
which I occasionally write, have decided to switch to the new spelling rules,
the newsletter is following suit -- even though at our age, we are not as
flexible anymore. But if Günter Grass is against it, I must be for it. Make way
for Angelika!

@Z: Photography Hour

<em>Angelika</em> 
So, now I finally want to contribute to the newsletter again. I can't
offer anything as exciting as skydiving (I'm not crazy), but as
Michael already mentioned, I've snagged the "monitor" job in the
darkroom. On Thursday (from 12 to 6 PM), I had my first shift, and it
went quite well since the beginning of the semester is usually not
that busy. This is great for getting accustomed.

In the darkroom, you
not only have to assist people with advice and support but also
prepare the necessary chemicals, wash the developed photos to remove any
remaining chemicals, dry them afterwards, and so on. I'm already
sure that I will fully take advantage of the opportunity to use the
darkroom anytime I want, as I've enrolled in two photography courses again
this semester. One course is a critique class where, as the name
suggests, the photos of the participants are critically examined.
Everyone chooses a project and works on compiling a portfolio.

The course instructor is Judy Dater, who is already relatively well-known, not
only because she has had numerous exhibitions at various museums but also
because she has met and photographed celebrities like Ansel Adams and Imogen
Cunningham. For those familiar with the photography scene, it's worth
mentioning that there is a picture with a nude model posing with Imogen
Cunningham in her later years, which Judy Dater photographed and is among her
most famous works. Oh my, you meet interesting people at Berkeley Extension.
Well, the courses do come with a hefty price tag.

My second course is titled "The Self-Portrait as Autobiography." Since it
doesn't start for another two weeks, I can't say much about it yet, but one
thing is certain: there will be a flurry of self-portraits in the near future.
Michael will be pleased. Also, my three exhibition photos (see the last
newsletter) are already hanging in the halls of the University of Berkeley
Extension. The exhibits are the result of my "Fine Printing" course. Each
participant is allowed to show three of their photos.

On Wednesday, the exhibition will be officially opened, with wine and
snacks, which the artists themselves have to provide (the road to fame is
tough). To be fair, it should be noted that "vernissage" might be a bit
of an overstatement, as usually friends, well-meaning acquaintances, and
sometimes a few teachers attend, so no critics or other prominent figures yet.
But at least it's a start, and the pictures are hanging in a public building,
accessible to everyone. But that's not all. Since the
University of Berkeley Extension has just extensively renovated a part of a
building in San Francisco, and Americans love to celebrate any occasion, the
completion of the renovation will be celebrated with much fanfare on October
14th, with the broad public and some important personalities in attendance.

For this reason, advanced students (including myself) were asked to submit up
to five of their own artworks (not just photos) for a chance to adorn the walls
at the opening ceremony. Naturally, I didn't hesitate and will seize the
opportunity, although the requirements here are a bit tougher. It's not certain
how many of my submitted pictures will make it, as a small jury selects them.
We'll see how it goes!

@Z: Hawaii -- Maui

<em>Angelika</em> 
We still have sand in our shoes from Hawaii... that's no joke,
because a week ago we returned from our one-week vacation, which we
spent this time on the island of Maui. Just like that, five hours on
a plane and you're in a tropical paradise, without even needing to
show your passport, since Hawaii is, as we know, part of the USA. The
word "Hawaii" probably conjures up images of surfers, palm trees,
sandy beaches, cocktails, landscapes like Jurassic Park (the movie
was actually filmed on Kauai), and floral print shirts not just for
us. And let me tell you, you can find all of that here. Sometimes you
really feel like you're looking at a postcard and not reality (see
Figure 9).

<pic images/hw9.ps Palm tree and sunset>

<pic images/hw2.ps The Lady and the Rental Car>

And the weather is world-class: It's never too hot, yet you never
need more than shorts and a T-shirt (even late at night). You can
safely leave socks, undershirts, sweaters, and jackets at home. The
ocean has such pleasant temperatures that even Michael spends hours
in it, and I do too, as I'm known to be a North German water rat. Of
course, every paradise has its downsides, because after all, everyone
wants to enjoy it, and others want to profit from tourism, so some
major construction sins have already been committed on Maui. And it's
so expensive that it makes you dizzy. A fish dish (without drinks,
appetizers, or dessert) in a somewhat nicer restaurant costs a
whopping 36 dollars, after all, you don't treat yourself to anything
else. And the argument that the exclusive location in the middle of
the ocean makes everything so expensive because everything has to be
transported there doesn't make sense for fish, since it's right at
the doorstep. Otherwise, Maui is quite large, so you can always find
quiet, less touristy spots. The beach in front of our hotel, for
example, was a beautiful white sandy beach where we were often almost
alone. On the last evening, we swam here while the sun set into the
sea before us. It was such a spectacle that my heart almost ached
from so much beauty. Of course, we also rented a so-called boogie
board again. It's the smaller version of a surfboard, with the
difference that you don't have to stand on it but ride the waves
lying on the board. So it's just right for beginners like us. You
should know that the waves in Hawaii are something else, after all,
top surfers from all over the world come here, always in search of
the perfect wave. In Hawaii, the seasons are also indicated by the
height of the waves. Winter (October to April) is the season when the
waves are murderously high at many beaches, and summer (May to
September) is the time when the ocean shows its friendlier side--it's
always pleasantly warm. Waves of 10 meters in height are not uncommon
in winter. At a beach called "Jaws" (the English title of the movie
"Der weiÃe Hai"), whose location the locals keep strictly secret,
surfers catapult themselves into waves with jet ski equipment that
most of us would avoid the ocean by a wide margin (Figure 10, archive
image).

<pic images/jaws.ps (Archivfoto) The translation of "Jaws - Jetzt
spinnen's!" to English is "Jaws - Now they're going crazy!>

We had, so to speak, caught the off-season. The anticipation of
winter and the high waves was there, but the ocean still appeared
relatively friendly, much to the disappointment of Michael, who
annoyed me daily by complaining that the waves weren't high enough
for him. It was enough for me because when we swam at the beach on
the first day (without a board at that time), we immediately had to
use the diving method to avoid being tossed around by the waves like
a cabbage. The diving method works as follows: If the waves are very
high, you have to dive under the wave before it breaks. If you wait
too long, masses of water crash down on you, creating a current that
tosses you around for several seconds, leaving you unsure of which
way is up. The trick works great, but it takes a bit of courage at
first. However, when the wave suddenly rolls in meters high in front
of you, you prefer to dive quickly. And one more thing about Maui: We
were also very impressed by the crater landscape "Haleakala," which
was formed during a volcanic eruption 200 years ago (Figure 12). It's
hard to describe how unique it looks; I imagine it to be like the
moon, and I'm probably quite right, as I read in the travel guide
that American astronauts prepared for their moon flight here because
the landscape is so similar to that on the moon. The crater is as
large as the New York City borough of Manhattan and is crisscrossed
by three hiking trails. We hiked one of these trails, which was not
entirely easy, as you descend into the crater landscape and
unfortunately have to return the same way, meaning it's constantly
uphill, and the air is a bit thinner due to the altitude, as the
summit is at 3100 meters. However, we were rewarded with a unique
natural spectacle: mist gently covering the crater landscape, the
rocks shimmering in various shades of red and gray, and a unique
silence, as hardly anything grows here and even animals can't
withstand the harsh conditions--so you only hear the rhythm of your
own footsteps over the hardened lava.

<pic images/hw7.ps The translation of "Im Vulkan" from German to
English is "In the Volcano.>

Anyone who has ever seen the Grand Canyon or something similar at
their feet knows how we felt. And since Maui is still fresh in our
memory, this time the quiz question is also about it: What are the
names of the inhabited islands of the state of Hawaii? The first
correct email and the first letter received through regular mail will
win the prize: a tropical surprise package.

Until next time, let us hear from you!

Michael.
