Hello, dear ones!

After my visit to Germany, I have already been back in San Francisco for four
weeks, so I believe it's time for another newsletter. A lot has happened with
us again. It is always amazing that, even though we have been living in San
Francisco for quite a while now, many things are still new to us. On the other
hand, we also perceive certain things differently now, which I always notice
when I read through the old newsletters.

@Z: Germany as a foreigner

<em>Angelika</em> Back to my visit to Germany: I really enjoyed the four weeks
in Germany and was especially happy that I was able to see and talk to so many
of you. Even though my visits to many of you were just brief stopovers and
therefore, of course, much too short. Those whom I didn't manage to visit,
please be understanding; four weeks is just a limited amount of time.

Many of you in Germany have repeatedly asked me these two questions: a) Can you
still speak German? b) Do you experience Germany differently now?

I believe I don't really need to answer question a) correctly; anyone who has
heard me talk knows that I chatter just as much as before. I think I still
manage to do that perfectly in the German language (the proofreader: "Modesty,
modesty..."). Perhaps some of you might have wished that bilingualism would
make me a bit more reserved, but unfortunately, I have to disappoint you, and I
don't think you should get your hopes up in that regard.

The second question is a bit more difficult to answer. When I think of Germany,
I primarily associate it with a lot of familiar things: my family, good
friends, many familiar, beautiful places. This, of course, hasn't changed at
all. On the other hand, there are some things that have struck me negatively,
which I might not have noticed otherwise. The problem, of course, is that when
you write about Germans or Germany, you always have to generalize; this simply
cannot be avoided, and as you all know, there is no such thing as "the German"
or "the American," and exceptions prove the rule. And yet, certain
characteristics can be more strongly attributed to one nation or another. 

First, I've noticed that Germans are a nation of complainers and pessimists (and I
would certainly include myself among the latter). I noticed this right away
when I was transferring in Atlanta. The plane was about half-filled with
Americans and German vacationers. Since Atlanta is known to be one of the
largest airports in the USA and thus has relatively heavy air traffic, we were
waiting at takeoff position 46, which meant the plane took off with about one hour
delay. For me, it was very interesting to observe how differently Germans
and Americans dealt with this situation.

The Americans mostly sat there relaxed, reading, with no one constantly
checking their watch or getting upset.  In contrast, four Germans, about 25
years old and just returning from vacation, were sitting in front of me. Not
only were they loudly complaining in German about the delay (good thing
Americans generally don't understand German), which made me quite embarrassed,
but they also checked their watches every two minutes, which, of course, didn't
help much. Later, these same Germans not only ordered a beer but insisted that
the stewardess bring each of them two at once.  Embarrassing!!!! No wonder
every American thinks that every German is born with a beer keg. You will now,
of course, argue that these Germans were the famous exceptions, but I have to
say that the complaining continued to follow me. The general tone everywhere
was that Germany is doing worse than ever, with real horror scenarios being
described (and I don't just mean in the media).

I definitely don't want to be misunderstood now. Of course, there are serious
problems in Germany -- as everywhere -- that urgently need to be addressed
to prevent a major crisis from developing. However, by serious problems, I do
not mean bitterly arguing over a spelling reform and involving the courts in
this matter. To be fair, it should be noted that Americans also like to take
every trivial matter to court. But that's a completely different topic that I
would prefer to address another time. Back to the German spelling reform: I
confess, I am in favor of a spelling reform and would have supported much more
radical changes. Incidentally, I now also consider this a German specialty:
clinging to unimportant things and not being willing to take even a small step
towards real, necessary changes. Suddenly, people remember that they are, after
all, the nation of Goethe and Schiller, although their language might have
looked somewhat different.

When you follow the discussion about the spelling reform from a bit of a
distance, you really have to wonder if Germany doesn't have any other problems
to tackle at the moment. I'm thinking, for example, of the high unemployment
rate, increasing poverty, the endangered welfare state, etc. In my opinion,
these are the issues that urgently need to be addressed.

@Z: Social benefits in comparison

<em>Angelika</em> I kept hearing during my visit to Germany that soon American
conditions would prevail in Germany regarding social security. Friends, I must
vehemently disagree on this point, and I sincerely hope that such conditions
will never exist in Germany. Take, for example, the troublesome issue of health
insurance. Firstly, about 40 million Americans are not insured at all, and
since the entire insurance system here is privately run, it happens that, for
instance, services for AIDS patients are not covered because their treatment is
too costly. Or, when switching insurance providers, which usually happens
automatically with a job change, any illness or even pregnancy that existed six
months before the change is not covered by the new insurance for up to a year.
Chronically ill people are truly lost in such a system.

Additionally, I've read that one American health insurance company did not
cover the costs for a disabled child because the parents knew beforehand that
there was a 50% chance they would have a disabled child. And I want to
emphasize once again that these are not isolated cases. But you don't even have
to go that far. Even if you are insured here, it can happen that the health
insurance provider does not pay in full what the doctor charges because it is
deemed too high to the insurance company. And in these cases, it is always the
patient who suffers, meaning they have to pay the difference.

For this very reason, there is an increasing trend here towards so-called
"managed care," meaning you are only allowed to go to certain doctors who have
contracts with the insurance company. These contracts stipulate that doctors
can only charge a certain fee for a specific service.  Then there are things
like deductibles or lifetime benefit limits of 1 million dollars, meaning once
the million is used up, no more payments are made by the insurer, and a million
can quickly be exhausted if you are seriously ill. And I emphasize once again,
these are generally people who are well off. I think things are still somewhat
different in Germany. It's unimaginable to extend this discussion to other
social benefits in America (e.g., unemployment insurance, pension insurance,
social assistance, vacation entitlement)!

To make my point absolutely clear once again: I consider it extremely important
that social benefits and the principle of solidarity are maintained in Germany.
This means that everyone -â€” whether a welfare recipient, bank director, or
employee at Siemens; black, white, or green-striped -- is insured and receives the
same benefits and is entitled to social benefits if they fall on hard times.
And I am more than willing to pay more when I am doing well, if I have the
assurance that I will not be completely abandoned should I find myself in a
situation of need.

I just realized that I've gone on about this topic for too long now, but
it just keeps occupying my mind. By the way, anyone who wants to read a good
book on the topic of "Germany" should check out the recent publication by former ARD
correspondent Gabriele Krone-Schmalz, "Now, Honestly! -- Thoughts on Germany."
Krone-Schmalz wrote the book after her return from Russia, and she noticed
quite similar things to what I have observed.

@Z: Nitpicking and pessimism

<em>Angelika</em> To return once more to the topic of complaining, the nagging and
pessimism: Americans might be the other extreme, being the eternal, almost unrealistic
optimist. They firmly believe that you can achieve anything if you just want it
enough. The dream of "dishwasher to millionaire" is still alive here. Even
the homeless person on the street or the black person living in the worst part
of the city, where gang wars, violence, and drugs are daily occurrance, still adhere
to this philosophy. Considering the fact that many black people will never
leave the ghetto and don't even have a high school diploma, this is quite a
bitter irony. In my opinion, this attitude also leads to the belief that
everyone thinks they can make it on their own, and Americans don't like it when
certain things are regulated by the government (e.g., introducing mandatory
health insurance).

Just one more thing I would like to mention regarding my visit to Germany. In
one aspect, Americans are really miles ahead of us, namely in their
friendliness. I am mainly referring to interpersonal interactions in the
service industry, but also to everyday interactions with one another.
Admittedly, it might have been a bit of a culture shock to fly into Munich,
where, as is well known, things are cordial but also a bit Bavarianly rough.

So let me quickly delight you with an experience from "the cosmopolitan city
with a heart" as Munich is being advertised as. During my visit to Domus, my
previous employer there, I was asked to buy pretzels and rolls for all the
Domus children from a Munich bakery, amounting to about 50 DM.  Although the
saleswoman handed me the requested pretzels, she simultaneously remarked
snappishly that next time I should definitely place such a large order a day in
advance, after all, she now had hardly any goods left for her customers, which
wasn't true because I was in a bakery that constantly bakes new rolls and
pretzels, but never mind. Such a thing would never happen to you in America.
Here, they would be more grateful that I spent so much money in one store, and
even if I had only bought something for 50 cents and it was the last roll on
the shelf, they would have gladly sold it to me. In Germany, on the other hand,
I often had the feeling that as a customer, you can be glad if you get anything
at all. Here, you can really ask the salesperson a million questions and try on
10 pairs of shoes without buying anything, or return the jeans you bought on
the next day without any explanation, and you will still be greeted with a
smile, and the smile is usually not fake or forced.

At the restaurant, at the hairdresser's, in the supermarket -- everywhere you
encounter the same friendliness. However, many believe that Americans in the
service industry are only friendly because they rely on tips or sales
commissions. There may be some truth to that, but I now tend to think that itâ€™s
more a matter of attitude. Here, you get the feeling that they enjoy selling
and don't see the customer as a necessary evil. And even if the friendliness is
just because of the tips, I still prefer that over being served by a grumpy
person.

There is, by the way, a place in America where one desperately searches for
friendliness, just as one does here, namely at government offices. However, this
seems to be a worldwide phenomenon.

Before I close, let me add why I believe that everyday interactions are also
friendlier here. In my opinion, this is because Americans are extremely talkative
and have mastered the art of small talk. Whether going up in an elevator,
waiting for the bus, or standing in line at the post office, Americans will
casually direct a few friendly words even to complete strangers. Admittedly,
these conversations are often about trivial topics like the weather, but I have
also experienced a woman on the street calling out to me that I was wearing an
especially cheerful T-shirt today, or a cashier admiring my earrings.
Regardless of whether these comments are sincere or not, they somehow make you
feel great.

@Z: Local News

<em>Angelika</em> Yes, yes, and what else has happened with us?  First of all,
I have been trying to get an internship position, and my first interview is
next week. I've applied to a school where children between the ages of 2 and
5 are cared for. Since the institution is located in a very poor neighborhood
of San Francisco, many children are affected by severe poverty and even
homelessness. Others have experienced drug abuse and violence in their families
and, as a result, have emotional problems. Other children at the center
come from immigrant families from all over the world who have just arrived in
San Francisco and therefore know little or no English. It all sounds very
exciting, and I am already quite nervous because it is not easy for me to do an
interview in a foreign language. If I am accepted at the center and I like
it there, I'll be working there three mornings a week.

At the same time, I have sought out opportunities of additional education and found
something interesting at the University of Berkeley. This place has a pretty
good reputation and conveniently offers a continuing education program for
professionals and other interested individuals. The courses take place either
in Berkeley (which is about 15 miles from San Francisco and easily accessible by
subway) or in San Francisco itself. The program I want to participate in is
called "Children and the Changing Family." This study program offers a variety
of courses on topics such as parental counseling, intervention options for
troubled youth, sexual abuse, social services in California, and more.

You can pick courses based on your interests. The classes are taught by
practitioners and are geared towards professional groups working with
children/youth and their families. If desired, you can also earn a certificate.
To do so, you must attend certain required courses and
complete 105 hours within three years. Additionally, you must pass each course
with a minimum grade of C (equivalent to a German grade of 3). To try it out,
I have enrolled in the course "African American Children and Their Families"
starting in November. This course deals with the lives of black families in
America, such as the conditions under which black people live in America today,
the forms of racism and societal prejudices they face, etc. I am really, really
looking forward to the course. By the way, the courses cost between $150 and
$200 each and are offered either as evening classes or as weekend seminars.

And then I will indulge myself in the luxury of taking a photography course,
which has long been my dream. The course is also offered through the Berkeley
continuing education program. It is taught by a woman who has already had
exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco.

You see, I have become really active in the last few weeks. My English course
at City College ended in late June. Although I could have enrolled in a new
one, I preferred to focus on the activities I just described, where you
naturally have to speak a lot of English and can certainly learn as well.

Then I believe I haven't mentioned yet that for some time now Iâ€™ve been doing
private translations from English into German. The connection came about
through various people. The wife of Michael's colleague Peter was initially
asked, but she didn't have the time or interest, so the task was passed on to
me. The woman for whom I'm doing the translations traveled on a container ship
with a German crew some time ago, and now she has gotten it into her head that
she wants her letters to Germans to be in German, even though she's
writing to speak English quite well. It's fine with me, as I'm making some
extra money under the table. It also turns out that she's in love with one of
the sailors, and now she's eager for me to teach her German. In any case, money
doesn't seem to be an issue for her, and it's helpful for me because I can
brush up on my English.

@Z: Timber Cove

<pic images/jenner.ps By the sea at Timber Cove.>

<em>Angelika</em> Next weekend we will be celebrating our first wedding
anniversary. We have decided to take the date of our church wedding as our
official anniversary. This is mainly for the pragmatic reason that this date is
engraved in our rings, providing Michael with a good memory aid. Looking back
on this year, an incredible amount has happened, and somehow the year has just
flown by. Naturally, we want to celebrate our anniversary accordingly. So, we
are heading to the coast up north and have booked a romantic hotel with
ocean view for two nights. To get up there, we will make our way through
the wine region and might even do a wine tasting. A truly Californian weekend!
We are definitely looking forward to it.

<pic images/racoon.ps A raccoon is stopping by on the balcony.>

Our friends Sylvia and Richard, by the way, moved to Portland at the end of
July because Richard started a new job there. Portland is located in the state
of Oregon and is about a 10-hour drive from San Francisco. For us, it's
naturally very unfortunate that they now live so far away, as spontaneous
meetups are no longer possible. Sylvia and Richard's baby is due at the end of
September, and Sylvia and I had already dreamed of starting our own playgroup.
That's obviously not possible now.

To conclude this newsletter, I would like to entertain you with two endless
stories: one of them concerns Michael's company.

@Z: Job search in the USA

<em>Angelika</em>
Most of you are already up to date on this, but some of you are not, so for the
sake of completeness, I'm quickly writing down the story again. In my last
newsletter, I described in detail that Michael is now working from home because
the Blaxxun office in San Francisco has closed, but the Blaxxun funding is
secured until early 1998. After Michael had just finished setting up all the
computers in our apartment, and I had gotten used to him turning our apartment
into an open-plan office, the next piece of bad news came (just before my
departure to Germany), namely that the funding was withdrawn again, and Blaxxun
will likely shut down completely by the end of June or July (including the
office in Munich).

Michael was advised to apply for a job at another company in San Francisco or the
surrounding area, as he also faces the additional challenge of needing a new
American visa for any potential new employer. Michael didn't hesitate and
immediately uploaded his resume to the internet. Thirty seconds later, the
first person called and offered him a job. In the age of the internet (at least
in the software industry), this is how it works: "recruiters" search the
internet on behalf of companies to identify suitable candidates and forward
them to the relevant firm. A recruiter functions much like a broker: if an
employment contract is signed, they receive a commission from the company.

So Michael first spoke with the recruiter and then with a responsible person
from the hiring company. He was surprised that instead of simply scheduling an
interview, they asked him actual test questions, such as how he would program
something in a specific language. This is because Americans often embellish
their resumes with things they haven't actually done. Americans also generally
enjoy phone conversations, which is very evident during the job application
process. It often happened that Michael spoke with two or three people from the
company over the phone, repeatedly answering the same questions, before being
invited for an in-person interview. At the interview, he had to speak with up
to seven different people (though in person, not over the phone). After these
conversations, the second phone phase begins.

If the company is interested in potentially hiring an applicant, they don't
want to see work references; instead, they ask for phone numbers of people
you've worked with before so they can call them and grill them about the
applicant. In some cases, they even call the university the applicant graduated
from to see if this actually checks out.  You can probably imagine that what I
just described doesn't go so smoothly when you come from Germany. The Americans
aren't too keen about calling internationally.

In any case, Michael was able to apply at Oracle, NASA (unfortunately not to
work as an astronaut, which would be his dream), two smaller companies, and
America Online. We were quite surprised that he was called in for so many
interviews, because it was clear from the start that the company would have to
pay a lawyer to apply for the new visa and wait 6 to 8 weeks for the visa
formalities to be completed, which is an eternity for an American company. The
lucky thing is that there is currently a significant shortage of software
developers here. Well, Michael decided to go with America Online (the world's
largest internet provider). Their office is in San Mateo, which is easily
accessible from San Francisco. The visa application is already in process, so
we are waiting for a positive response.

The story is not over yet, however, there's more Blaxxun news: The company has
recovered, and funding is now secured again until early 1998. The good thing
about this is that Michael can continue working for them until the new visa
comes through, so we don't have to struggle financially.

And something else, quite funny, from Black Sun: itâ€™s now called Blaxxun. But
the people who email me can still use the old spelling. I tell you, with this
company, you really go through a thousand adventures.

TODO

@Z: Bureaucratic negligence at the driver's license office

<em>Sure, "Angelika" is a name and does not require translation. It is used similarly in English. If you need any further assistance or context, please let me know!</em>So, and now to my driver's license. After finally passing the test, I patiently waited for it to be sent to me from the California state capital, Sacramento, which can take up to 6 months because, for us foreigners, they also check if we are legally in the country. After almost 7 months, I finally received a notice from Sacramento that they were missing the documents needed for verification! In plain terms, this means that the DMV forgot to copy my passport and visa. So, I had to go back to the DMV in San Francisco with my passport, where they copied it and assured me that the papers were now in order. I then politely asked how long it would take for the driver's license to be sent to me. To which I received the same answer, "up to 6 months." The problem now is that I took my theoretical exam back in January, and one must receive the plastic card driver's license within a year, otherwise, you have to retake the test. You can probably imagine how furious I was because, in the worst-case scenario, this deadline will be exceeded for me. If I have to retake my driver's license test due to bureaucratic incompetence, I will lose it. Michael, of course, is having a field day with this story and constantly teases me about it.

So, my dears, I've reported enough from here now. Wish me luck for my job interview.

Wishing you all a wonderful summer!

All the best!!!

Angelika
