@Z: Christmas 2012

Before we get ready to celebrate Christmas eve this year, let me send out
my traditional Christmas news letter. A lot has
happened in 2012! It has been an election year, and the news outlets have 
switched to other topics in the meantime, but I'd like to revisit the topic
today. Curiously, we're currently snowed in in Incline village near Lake
Tahoe, and thus are experiencing "White Christmas" for the first time 
in many years. Merry Christmas and a successful new year to you all!

Angelika and Michael

<em>Dear Barack Obama,</em>

I would have never imagined to have the opportunity to write you this
letter, as I was fairly convinced that you wouldn't be be able to pull 
off a second
win in the presidential race. It was a very close outcome this time, 
and if people claim the opposite, they're diehard optimists. 
It seemed that everyone
was tired of the process, including yourself, because many items on your 
election agenda from 2008 you either weren't able to or didn't want to
address. Living in the White House seems to change people or at least 
seems to set them apart from real life.

May I suggest that you'll now take on a few topics that you've already 
promised us in 2008? Either way, there's one thing we'll always be thankful
for: 
Introducing a quasi mandatory health insurance was a big accomplishment. 
I'd wager that this will go on record in the history books and looking
back, Americans will rub their eyes in disbelief when they hear that there
once was a time without health insurance being available for everyone.

And since Christmas is that time of the year when wishes are 
granted, here's a few for your next term:

1) Close Guantanamo Bay.

2) Speaking of Cuba: It's about time to lift the travel restrictions to
Cuba for U.S. citizens and greencard holders.

3) Increase gas prices and funnel the proceeds into public transportation
and green projects.

4) Start the immigration reform. Granting amnesty to the millions of illegal
immigrants who have been living and working in the United States for decades
is the pragmatic way of fixing it.

5) Increase taxes, and not only for the super rich.

6) Take the opportunity and tighten gun control.

7) Don't just always compromise with the Republicans.

Also, I believe that you'll be a much better politian when you'll be able
to turn your back to the White House in four years and break free from your 
advisors and the Washington lobbyists. 

Best of luck, and we hope you'll be able to relax over the Christmas holidays
on Hawaii.

Angelika
