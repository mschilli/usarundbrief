@Z: Christmas 2013

Christmas and New Year are around the corner, 2013 has
just flown by. Following tradition, during this time,
there's good wishes abound for happyness and a healthy life.

In 2014, many Americans hopefully no longer need to fear that a severe
illness will ruin them financially. We're witnessing a historical moment
as all people across the United States will have access to health
insurance, despite persistent protests and fierce debate.

The change isn't coming easy, and it's not only the technical difficulties
with the government-operated website selling health insurance, which turned
out to be brittle patchwork.

But sooner or later, we think it'll become evident that having access to
health insurance is a basic right. The new legislation will sure
have to be amended going forward, but to give you an idea on what
it looks like, we'll present a hopefully entertaining quiz with some
maybe not so obvious facts today.

Have a merry Christmas and a healthy, happy 2014!
