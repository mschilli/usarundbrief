@Z: Nutrition labels hide total calorie counts

<pic images/tzatziki-pot.ps (#3) A pot of cucumber yogurt dip. How many calories total is this?>

<em>Michael</em> 
Every shrink-wrapped food item for sale in the U.S., ranging from a
box of serial to a candy bar, from a can of beans to a packed
sliced salami, prominently displays its
<LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition_facts|"Nutrition Facts"</LINK>
(Figure (#1)). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been requiring
this information since 1990, and it lists in detail, how many calories, 
how much fat, sugar, salt or vitamins are contained in a product. This
way, the consumer can make an informed choice before buying or eating
a product and knows if it will be contributing to their waistline or 
raise their cholesterol.

<pic images/tzatziki-label.ps (#1) According to the label, this spread only has 30 calories.>

But take a look at the pack of yoghurt-cucumber spread in Figure (#3): Doesn't
the 30 calories count (20 from fat) sound suspiciously low? Indeed, because
it doesn't refer to the complete package content, but only to an amount
defined by the manufacturer as "serving size", as explained further down
on the label. This is the tiny amount the customer is supposed to consume from
the package. If you eat the entire thing, much more than 30 calories will
go straight to your bulgy problem areas, because according to the label, 
the package contains no less than 31 serving sizes. I presume that
if the label said "this cucumber yoghurt contains 900 calories", the yoghurt
would collect dust on the supermarket shelves. For this reason, the
manufacturers manipulate the serving sizes, until the calorie count
drops to a reasonable amount, although hardly anyone will just take
a teaspon of yoghurt, apply it on a cracker and then return 
the entire package to the refrigerator.

<HTMLONLY><pic images/tzatziki-front.ps A delicious, low-calorie spread. Or is it?></HTMLONLY>

What other information is printed on the label? 
It says that the serving size of 20 grams of 
yoghurt (less than one ounce) contains 2 grams of fat, which consists of
1 gram saturated fat and 0 trans-fat, which has been pretty much 
<LINK>http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/state/20080130-0805-ca-transfatban.html|banned|San Francisco bans trans fat</LINK>
from restaurants in San Francisco anyway. 
The missing gram to arrive at a total of 2 grams of fat apparently got lost
in a rounding error. The serving size also includes 5 milligrams of
cholesterol (a completely useless measure as it's unrelated to the body's
cholesterol level) and 95 milligrams of sodium which is mostly contained
in table salt and covers about 4% of the daily intake, according to the label.
If you can't help but eat the entire pack, that would be 120% of your 
recommended daily salt intake, so pace yourself!

@Z: The Supreme Court's Gay Marriage Ruling

<pic images/city-hall-prop-8.ps Protesters opposing proposition 8 in San Francisco, in front of City Hall. Photo: flickr[Frank Farm|frankfarm/3034085292]>

<em>Angelika</em>
In June, the Supreme Court, the highest and final legal instance
in the United States, ruled on two important issues regarding gay marriage.
A private citizen named Edith Windsor had filed a lawsuit against the
so-called "Defense of Marriage Act" (short: DOMA). DOMA was signed into law
in 1996 by then-president Bill Clinton, and said that individual states 
were no longer required to acknowledge legally granted same-sex marriages 
(e.g. by other states). DOMA determined a marriage to be valid only
between a man and a woman and explicitly did not recognize same-sex 
marriages in the same way.

This put legally married same-sex partners at a disadvantage, because 
they were denied federal benefits like jointly-filed income tax reports, 
higher exemptions on inheritance tax, health insurance for 
family members, or surviving spouse social security. Also, U.S. immigration
didn't recognize same-sex marriages, which means that same-sex spouses 
of legal immigrants weren't automatically granted a visa or Green Card.

Edith Windsor had married her partner Thea Spyer in 2007 in Canada. Both
of them were living in New York state. When Thea died, she bequeathed all
of her assets to Edith, but the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
didn't recognize their marriage, which was legally granted in Canada, 
and Edith faced $360,000 in inheritance taxes, because she couldn't 
claim the spouse exemption.

<pic images/allstate-gay.ps The well-known insurance "Allstate" is running ads pro same-sex marriage in San Francisco.>

The United States Supreme Court now ruled in her favor. The judges argued
that DOMA violates the "due process clause" of the 5th amendment of the
Constitution. The ruling is historical and groundbreaking. However, the
Supreme Court emphasized that it's now up to the individual states to legalize
same-sex marriages or pass legislation against them. This is bound to lead
to considerable confusion, because individual government offices apply 
different rules when it comes to providing benefits at the federal level.

The immigration department, for instance, will grant visas or Greencards to
spouses or family members, i.e. children, regardless whether 
the marriage license was issued in the U.S. or in a foreign country.
From previous editions of this publication, 
you might remember that Michael obtained 
his Greencard through his employer, and I received one as well,
simply because I'm married to him. This benefit now extends to all 
legal same-sex marriages.

However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Social Security 
Administration are operating by different rules. Tax or social benefits are
determined by the individuals' residence, which means that same-sex couples
will only receive benefits in states where same-sex marriages are legal.
You can easily see that there's a lot more work to be done and 
looming litigation until finally everyone enjoys equal rights.

The second case decided by the Supreme Court ruled over
California Proposition 8 (<RBLINK>20081120#7</RBLINK>). The latter
put same-sex marriages on hold in California in 2008, by defining 
marriage to be legal only between a man and a woman. In return,
opponents immediately challenged Proposition 8 in the US District Court
and judge Vaughn Walker ruled in their favor, arguing that 
Proposition 8 was discriminatory and hence violated the constitution 
of the State of California.

Alas, this did not render same-sex marriages legal in California, since
government agencies and courts were waiting dutifully until the case had
made its way through the higher courts. Then, the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals in California agreed in February 2012 that Proposition 8 was 
violating constitutional rights, and the case went on to the 
highest federal court in the US, the Supreme Court. The judges there,
however, dismissed the case because it wasn't the State of California
filing the suit, but merely proponents of Proposition 8. The US Supreme
Court decided that a lawsuit regarding the constitution of the State of 
California can only be filed by the State of California itself and not
by a private party not officially representing the state.
It thereby also voided the decision of the lower Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals, because it wasn't the State of California filing that 
lawsuit either. What remained was the first decision at the lowest court
(Perry vs. Schwarzenegger), where the court had ruled Proposition
unconstitutional, and that's the reason why since end of June there's
been a flurry of legal same-sex marriages throughout California. The first
one of course was held in San Francisco.

@Z: German Tagesschau Won't Broadcast Certain Segments

<pic images/roku-tv.ps (#4) The little Roku device (bottom left) fetches the German news show "Tagesschau" via the Internet onto our TV at the push of the remote control button.>

<em>Michael</em>
As you probably already know, we've gotten into the habit of watching the 
daily German news show "Tagesschau" by help of a small
streaming device called <LINK>http://www.roku.com|Roku</LINK> in our
living room.
It's really easy to do, since the sandwich-sized box supports not only
Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, and about a dozen other content providers,
but also this most famous German news show. Three clicks with the remote,
and within 10 seconds, it starts running on our TV in San Francisco. 
Thanks to the time difference, on the weekends, we often watch the 
8:00pm show already in the early afternoon.

<pic images/tagesschau-content-restricted.ps (#5) The German news show "Tagesschau" is prohibited from broadcasting the sports segment on the Internet.>

I find that the "Tagesschau" with its 15 minutes of pure daily news really fits
my needs. Their reporting is neutral, without much filler material, the
only complaint I have is that they always announce some political figurehead
visiting a disaster area with the phrase 
"to get an impression on the situation", on which the editor in chief should
ring the alarm bells and cut it out of the manuscript immediately. It's
really getting old, Tagesschau, have you realized that yet?

But the reason why I'm talking about this topic today is that towards
the end of the show, on weekends, there's almost always a sports segment
with some footage on the current league soccer games. Unfortunately, 
it is always blocked in its entirety by the ugly censor screen in Figure (#5).
I can imagine that it is greedy content peddlers strong-arming the public 
German TV station to suppress this information.
The same annoyance occurs with Formula One car races. Only exotic sports
like women's soccer or tennis are being broadcasted freely. 
And earlier today, I've witnessed a new low: At the end of the newscast, there
was a report on a newly erected historical site to commemorate Nazi 
euthanasia crimes, and while airing some historical footage in 
black-and-white the same censor screen came on: "For legal reasons, 
this content cannot be shown on the Internet". Really, Tagesschau? 
Sometimes I think some of the content regulators need to get
their heads examined.

@Z: Our Subway, BART, is on strike

<pic images/bart-train.ps BART: The Bay Area's subway system>

<em>Angelika</em>
By American standards, San Francisco and the Bay Area are exemplary
when it comes to public transportation offerings. There's buses, street
cars, and a subway. The subway system BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) features
a single line within the limits of the city of San Francisco, extending all
the way south to SFO airport, but also also connects the East Bay
(Oakland, Richmond, Berkeley, Pleasanton) with San Francisco,
crossing the Bay waters via an underwater tunnel.

Since San Francisco is surrounded by water, you'll run into a bridge to 
be crossed sooner or later, which during rush hour inevitably leads
to hopelessly clogged roads. On the Bay Bridge, connecting San Francisco and
Oakland on the East Bay side, there's often bumper-to-bumper traffic and
disgruntled drivers are stuck in traffic for hours. For this reason,
the BART subway system is an indispensable transportation alternative.
About 400,000 commuters are using BART every day. In my personal opinion,
that's still too few, but the rider numbers have doubled in the last
fifteen years. In recent weeks, we've found out the hard way how 
important BART has become: BART workers went on strike between July 1st and
4th.

<pic images/bart-gate-locked.ps BART customers were locked out for four consecutive days during the strike.>

Labor protests are relatively rare in the US, as unions have been weakened
over the years. The last time BART workers went on strike was sixteen years
ago, for example. But it still happens. BART employees are, to put
it simply, public servants of the State of California. On top of 
ticket sales, BART is supported by the tax payers, it's not a private
company.

What were the striking BART workers looking for? 
No doubt for higher compensation,
but also for better social benefits. As a non-resident, you're probably 
surprised to hear that in the U.S., many social benefits, like vacation,
aren't regulated by law. Instead, there are significant differences in what 
individual companies offer their employees. BART management wants, for
example, that their employees increase their montly payments for their 
health benefits and raise the contributions for the corporate 
pension fund, of which the employer is currently paying the entire amount.
Also, every BART employee pays $92 per month for health insurance, regardless
of how many family members (e.g. children) are covered.

<HTMLONLY><pic images/bart-sign.ps This usually busy station is now shut down because of the BART strike.></HTMLONLY>

It's quite the norm in the U.S. that affluent tech companies pay their 
employee's health insurance premiums in full, requesting only
a small contribution from employees in most cases. 
Companies like Apple, Google, Yahoo have been doing that for years 
to be able to attract qualified and happy software specialists. 
My employer's health plan, on the other hand, requires employees to 
foot a much larger amount, although our salaries are tiny in comparison. 
For this reason, I prefer to be insured with Michael, 
although I'm working full time.

BART workers take home surprisingly high salaries, compared to other positions
in the industry only requiring a high school diploma. Depending on who you ask,
employees or BART management, a BART worker's yearly base salary runs 
somewhere between $60,000 and $80,000, and on top of that, there's an
obscure system of overtime payments and social benefits.

<pic images/bart-glen-park.ps Only a few pigeons have been seen today at the usually busy Glen Park BART station.>

This inevitably led to some resentment expressed by Bay Area citizens, 
although they are known for their liberal views. Many felt that the strike
wasn't justified. I think it's about time to establish better working
condition for all workers across the entire U.S., like statutory requirements
for sick days and maternity leave. But that's probably a pipe dream, in
light of how elected officials quarreled with each other to get 
the national health insurance in place. In any case, since July 5th,
BART has been operating normally again, since the old labor agreement 
was extended by 30 days. But this means that there's a chance that the
trains will stop running again next month, if the two parties can't 
get to an agreement.

@Z: Top Product: The Peeramid pyramid for reading on your iPad

<pic images/peeramid-solo.ps Simple, but very handy: The reading pyramid for the E-book Reader>

<em>Michael</em> 
If you like reading on your iPad while sitting in your favorite recliner 
or lying in bed, you're familiar with how heavy the device gets all of 
a sudden. Wham-bam, and you're snoozing off, but you really wanted to keep
reading! To combat this problem, I recently bought a 
<LINK>http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00771NUSY|pyramid-shaped pillow named Peeramid</LINK> from Amazon, after getting curious by the raving reviews the item
had received. It sits on your lap or on the blanket and keeps the iPad
upright at an angle for reading without having to hold it upright.

<pic images/peeramid-chair.ps Michael with his iPad in the reclining chair.>

This device is the best innovation since sliced bread! It looks pretty
funny, like a diploma hat with a tassel attached to it at the end of
a 2-foot rope. Its velvet cover is 
pleasant to the touch, and it holds the iPad securely in place, even when 
I'm so tired that I'm about to doze off. If it's lying somewhere near,
just grab the tassel and pull it towards you. It's about $25 on Amazon.com,
which is an outragious amount of money for an item that's probably been made
for not more than $5 in China, but it's really nicely sewn and the high-quality 
cover will even satisfy demanding customers. And it's well-known that 
I have no problem paying a premium for quirky new products. Top product!

@Z: Climbing at Planet Granite

<pic images/planet-granite-low.ps One of the USArundbrief editors climbs up the wall at the climbing gym "Planet Granite". Foto: Bettina Oswald>

<em>Michael</em> 
If I'm not mistaken, the obsession of climbing indoors on artificial walls
must have originated in Germany, or how else would you explain that I've 
been doing that since the 90ies, back then at the Thalkirchen climbing 
center in Munich? In the U.S., the sport is 
called "indoor climbing" and there's a 
micro-chain gym called "Planet Granite" in San Francisco and the surrounding
Bay Area that offers several fitness clubs with rock climbing walls. 
After a hard day's work, it's quite common to meet fellow 
techies there, and ironically also often German-speaking immigrants.
Almost every Wednesday, I've been hanging out there with our friends
Bettina, Miguel, Chris and Tranquilla for quite some time.

I remember that back in Munich, we just showed up at the outdoor 
climbing facility in Thalkirchen with climbing shoes, a rope and a couple
of hooks, and off we went up the climbing walls. In the U.S., with its
litigious society, it's more strictly regulated. When I showed up
at Planet Granite many years ago for the first time, the staff there 
wanted to talk me into pay for a beginner's climbing class to learn 
belay techniques, which I already had on auto-pilot because I had been 
using them successfully for many years. Luckily, I convinced them to start
their certification process for free with me, by me showing them how to 
tighten knots and using their belay device safely.

<pic images/planet-granite-high.ps I'll manage even overhanging walls if they're not too steep (this one has a rating of 5.10a) Photo: Bettina Oswald>

Belaying isn't hard and an average person can learn the knots and 
rope techniques within a couple of minutes. But I demonstrated the procedure 
slightly differently to them, 
boldly deviating from the climbing gym's holy scripture, and they
failed me the first time! The second time, I did it exactly as they 
wanted and passed. Ever since, my climbing belt has a red card hanging 
from it, which authorizes me to belay other climbers. It is only applicable
to the so-called top rope technique, which uses a fixed rope already
installed on the route. With this, the belayer constantly keeps tightening 
the rope, so that the climber will never fall more than a foot or two, even
if they slip badly. But with the red card license, I'm not permitted to bring
my own rope and lead, or belay someone leading, for that matter. 
For this, they require
another, more advanced certification, and upon passing, you'll proudly 
display a green laminated card 
bouncing from your belt. Clearly ridiculous, but, hey, who am I to complain.
Every installed rope comes with a rope-stopping device called a 
<LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigri_(climbing)|Grigri</LINK>, which
is dead-simple to use and allegedly 
provides better safety than the half-mast knots we used instead in Munich. 
Patrolling staff members make sure everyone using the Grigri holds the
outcoming rope tighly in their hand and downwards, to make sure the
Grigri's safety is enabled, and if they spot someone who doesn't, 
they'll approach them quickly and remind them in no uncertain terms of the 
correct procedure.

What's surprising is that the American grading system for climbing routes
differs significantly from the "UIAA" system used in Germany. From way back
when, I remembered that a "4" is a route with handles so generous 
that you can just
walk up there like you're climbing a ladder. A "5" offers less obvious
ways to hold on and climbing a "6" actually requires knowing some
climbing technique, or there's no way to proceed. The American
grading system is quite different, as documented in
<LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)#Free_climbing_2|Klettergradvergleichstabelle auf Wikipedia</LINK>, and its grades
5.4 to 5.6 correspond to the UIAA rating of 4, the slightly higher
5.7 to 5.9 to the UIAA 5, and more advanced 5.10a, 5.10b, 5.10c, 5.10d and 
5.11a to the UIAA 6.

There's more highly graded routes, but according to my experience, those walls 
can only be scaled by Spiderman-like creatures. What's also interesting
is that climbing as a hobby in the US also seems to serve as a way to meet new
people, the climbing gym even has special events for singles to hook
up with new prospective mates!

@Z: Lagavulin Whiskey

<pic images/lagavulin.ps One of the best Whiskeys on earth: Lagavulin 16.>

<em>Michael</em>
Whiskey, oder "whisky", as people from the UK say, is a distilled liquid, 
mostly made from malted grains. The basis for American Bourbon whiskeys
is usually corn, whereas Scottish whiskeys ("Scotch") typically use 
malted barley. As you can find out by watching the unlisted 
Youtube video <LINK>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bFwABaP3Ts|Whisky. The Islay Edition</LINK>, it is first and foremost the small Scottish Island of Islay, 
which specializes in producing so-called "peat" whiskeys by malting 
barely over peat-fueled fire, which adds the typical marshy, 
smoky scent and flavor. Coincidentally, if you open up your desktop
computer and hold your nose close to the motherboard, you'll likely 
pick up similar scents.

<pic images/lagavulin-pronounce.ps Actor Brian Cox tastes various Scotch whiskeys and demonstrates their correct pronunciation.>

I recently found out about a Scotch Whiskey named "Lagavulin". Strangely, 
it surfaced 
on several of my radar screens around the same time. 
First, someone sent me a link to 
a website featuring <LINK>http://www.esquire.com/blogs/food-for-men/scotch-whisky-brands-list-5841578|actor Brian Cox who pronounces Scotch Whiskey names|Brian Cox pronounces Scotch Whiskey names</LINK>.
Which is not as easy as you might think, because if you apply the 
pronunciation rules of the English language on Scottish names, 
usually nothing sensible comes out of it, or did you wisenheimers know how
to pronounce "Bruichladdich"?

In one of the short videos, Brian Cox calls Lagavulin the "cognac of whiskeys"
and assures that the beverage works like a depth charge, used to get submarines
into trouble. 

<pic images/lagavulin-parkrec.ps In the TV series "Parks and Recreation" Ron Swanson loves his Lagavulin.>

And finally, Lagavulin appeared in one of the very few American TV series
that I'm watching frequently: "Parks and Recreation". The head of
the bureaucrats of the parks department in the series
is an excentric individual named
Ron Swanson, who only eats meat and washes it down with whiskey. Lagavulin
whiskey, of course. Why anyone in his right mind would pair a steak
with peaty whiskey instead of a California Cabernet Saugvignon, boldly 
developed in oak barrels, is a question that I suspect can only be answered
by the "Parks and Rec" product placement sales goons.

<pic images/lagavulin-costco.ps (#2) Lagavulin 16 at Costco is 13 Dollars off today, now it's only 54.99 Dollar per bottle.>

<pic images/lagavulin-store.ps Lagavulin is on sale at the local supermarket.>

Then, the mega supermarket chain Costco caused the next blip on my radar 
screen. It had Lagavulin on sale and lowered the price from
$67.99 per bottle to "only" $54.99, which is why I bought two 
(Figure (#2)). The "Lagavulin 16" single malt ages for 16 years and has
an extremely strong peat taste. It is to be consumed at room temperature, 
and I've heard stories of colleagues at work who showed American 
visitors the door after they had asked if they could get Lagavulin
served on the rocks. Unbelievable!

@Z: Summer vacation

<pic images/camp-galileo.ps During the summer vacation, some parents drop off their kids at summer camp.>

<em>Angelika</em>
In the U.S., just like anywhere else, school kids are eagerly awaiting
their summer vacation. With two to three months of school being closed 
during the summer, depending on the school district, school kids here 
have more time off than in Germany. In San Francisco, the last school day
was May 31st, and children are returning to their classrooms on August 19th.
Typical months for summer vacation are June, July, and August.
Rumor has it that the reason for this choice is that formerly in rural areas, 
children had to help with the harvest. Others claim that it's due to the
unbearable heat during the sommer months in major metropolitan areas that
schools are closed during this time. Be it as it may, the fact is that 
long summer vacations enjoyed by U.S. school kids are here to stay.

But what are children supposed to do with their free time during the long
summer vacation, when, as in many families in the U.S., both parents are
working and often are granted only two weeks off? One option is the
so-called summer school, where children can catch up on school matters, to
get their grades up. However, this is usually only offered for children
in high school. Also, many universities are offering sommer classes which 
many students take advantage of to speed up getting their degree. Children
with special needs, even if they're usually integrated in regular classrooms,
usually receive four weeks of extra lessons and therapy 
(speech therapy, ergo therapy, etc.), because the long time off school can
lead to a loss of skills they've already acquired. This is called "extended
school year", and the children I work with mostly get four weeks of extra
classes.

And then there's the so-called "summer camps". I used to believe that 
every American child gets dropped off at a scout camp during summer,
where they learn how to start bonfires and carve wooden figurines. 
Imagine a group of distressed teachers who have to spend the night 
in wooden cottages next to oodles of children! But while such overnight
stay camps still exist, there's lots more choices nowadays, like surf camps,
trips where children learn foreign languages, adventure tours or camps
that teach how to make movies, believe it or not, 
in the streets of New York or Paris.
Younger children often attend "day camps" and sleep at home at night. 
There's lots of different choices there was well. During the summer months,
I'm often accompanying a child with autism I work with to a summer camp,
to help him integrate into the camp group. In San Francisco and the
surrounding Bay Area, <LINK>http://www.galileo-camps.com|Camp Galileo</LINK>
has a good reputation. I just went there last week with one of the children
I work with. Every week, they're teaching a different subject, like
space travel, tropical safaris, or medieval times. Children at the camp
are playing games, tinker with materials, and run small scientific 
experiments. Their parents sign them up for one week, or sometimes 
even for several weeks in a row. It is not exactly cheap, though, one week
at the Galileo Camp, which runs from 9am till 3pm daily, clocks in at
about $360 to $380, but they offer discounts for additional weeks.

You can probably find less expensive offerings, but their programs often
are lacking in quality. The camps are typically run by enthusiastic
college students, who take the opportunity to make some money on the side
during their summer vacation. I'm not sure, though, if they realize how
exhausting this job can be, because they continually have to
adapt to new rascals coming on board!

@Z: Vacation Rental By Owner

<pic images/vrbo-patio.ps Michael sitting on the patio of a vacation rental on Hawaii.>

<em>Angelika</em>
In March, we once again packed our bags and went on a trip to the Hawaiian 
island of Oahu. We've given up on hotels for quite some time already, and
nowadays always rent vacation homes, not only because there's no hotels in
our favorite spot, Kailua. Since we know exactly what we want and have become
pretty familiar with the neighborhood, I always get a place to stay via
"vrbo.com" ("Vacational Rental by Owner"). On the site, owners offer their
vacation homes from around the world for rent.

If you're looking for a place on Oahu, click on the US map, then drill down
to the state of Hawaii, then on the island of Oahu, and you'll see various
offerings in different locations on the island. Filtering by the number
of bedrooms required, whether ocean front is a must, or availability by 
a preset date narrows down the search. Inquiries to property owners are 
usually answered within one or two days. 

<pic images/vrbo-inside.ps Typical vacation rental on Hawaii: wooden floors and rattan style furniture.>

Renting a property requires a prepayment of a couple of hundred dollars 
and sending a signed contract to the owner. The entire rent then needs
to be paid four weeks before the rental date. Most owners want it via
check or money order, only few accept credit cards, as those require them
to pay a processing fee.

<pic images/vrbo-grill.ps A charcoal grill is a must on Hawaii.>

We're pretty amazed every time how flawlessly this process works. The 
landlords typically aren't on the island, but are living somewhere on 
the US mainland. Usually, they let a Hawaiian resident manage the 
property. In March, we rented a place in Lanikai, a small bordering 
neighborhood to Kailua. I only called the property manager once before we 
went there and we didn't see him even once during the entire time we 
were there. The house key was placed inside the house when we arrived, 
and we left it on the kitchen table when we left. For emergencies, we had
the manager's and the cleaning lady's phone number. The place was 
great, as you can tell by the pictures.

@Z: Hawaii: Public Access to the Beaches

<pic images/surfer-dude.ps Michael is probably one of the oldest surfers at the beach of Honolulu.>

<em>Angelika</em>
Even on Hawaii, not everything is like it should be in paradise. Cluttering
the islands with new construction projects is an ongoing problem. The locals
are understandably not happy that it's mostly wealthy individuals buying 
real estate that they then only use a few times a year as vacation homes. 
Those houses often have gigantic footprints and are located in close 
vicinity to the beach, but are uninhabited most of the time. 

For this reason, I'm happy that the State of Hawaii passed legislation
back in the year 1974 to ensure that all Hawaiian beaches must be accessible
by the public. 

<pic images/hawaii-public-access.ps Public access trail to a beach on Oahu.>

No hotel or property owner can declare a beach to be his private property.
In Kailua and Lanikai, where we're usually staying when we're on Oahu, there
are usually inconspicuous sandy trails leading from the main road to the
beach, passing between privately owned land. A sign at the trail head 
points out that there is public beach access. People heading for the beach
of course then park their cars all over the place next to these trail heads,
which the home owners find somewhat annoying, especially when it's tourists
parking there. Many property owners try to limit access to the beach
for this reason. Some get the nearby streets converted to private
roads, on which they prohibit non-residents from parking. That's the end of
peaceful Aloha!

But on public streets, which you can discern by the lack of "Private Road"
signs, even tourists are allowed to park their cars in good concience. 
This includes even the nicely trimmed grassy areas in front of fenced-in
properties, unless there are official signs saying otherwise.

Greetings from heavily regulated paradise:

Angelika \& Michael
