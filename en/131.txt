@Z: Rent cars from private owners: Turo

<pic images/turo-tesla.ps Over the weekend, it's fun to rent a sports car with an electric motor.>

<em>Michael</em> On vacation, we regularly drive around in rental cars in
foreign cities. Typically, you book a "category" and not a specific car type. Once, at
Sixt in Munich, I booked the "VW Golf GTI" class, but at the counter, they
tried to give me an Opel Mandriva, a minivan for soccer moms. In Las Vegas, I
once booked a Prius, but when I showed up, there was no Prius available. I made
a fuss and was eventually appeased with a Japanese sports car, an Infiniti
G37S. But I've always wanted to drive a Prius, the legendary hybrid car that
Americans have been using to save gas for about 20 years, because the small
gasoline engine keeps charging a large battery that then powers the car without
gasoline during calm driving phases. While our Honda Fit guzzles a good eight liters
per 100 km (30 miles/gal), a Prius manages with just four (60 miles/gal).
I know, I know, in Germany people
drive around in Matchbox cars that also only consume four liters (60 miles/gal), but in
America, you can't get by with less than 100 horsepower.

<pic images/prius-chatta.ps Michael is posing on our local hill in a Prius C from Turo.>

Recently, the company Turo set out to break through the jungle of regulations
and insurance for commercial car rentals (similar to how AirBnB did for hotels
and Uber for taxis) and to act as an agency through which private individuals
can rent out their cars to other private individuals. According to my research, the
company already exists in Germany as well! Using a smartphone app, you can
choose from a wide range of cars, plan a "trip," and then the renter ("Guest")
meets with the owner ("Host") at the agreed upon pickup time for the key handover,
and off you go. The app is used to take photos of the car at both pickup and
return to ensure that the renter hasn't caused any new damage. Finally, both
the renter and the owner rate each other with up to five stars so that future
Turo customers know what kind of person they're dealing with.

<pic images/turo-web.ps Turo primarily rents out Teslas and luxury cars.>

Newer Prius models were available in San Francisco on Turo for about $60 per
day, and I chose a rental with comprehensive insurance with a high deductible ($3000),
which cost an additional $15 per day. Overall, a worthwhile fun for the
weekend. For luxury cars, however, you pay a bit more, for example, around $150
for a Tesla Model S. But well, that's obviously much cheaper than the purchase
price of $80,000. Since private cars mostly just stand around doing nothing,
the business is equally rewarding for both renters and owners. The owner gets a
part of their immense acquisition and maintenance costs reimbursed, and the
renter has the opportunity to drive the car of their dreams, even if it's just
for a day, saving themselves from buying a vehicle that quickly depreciates in
value.

<pic images/turo-mike.ps Who wouldn't want to lend their private car to this model customer?>

Pickup and return went smoothly in our self-test. The rental provider turned
out to be an exceptionally nice person from a neighboring district, who even
took the time to explain the various energy-saving modes of the vehicle to me
and to give some good driving tips. It was fun to use the little car to complete
our usual weekend routines: grocery shopping, going to Ikea, to the football
field, and so on. The Prius C, the short version of the original model, is of
course not a sports car, but you get used to it. After a while, driving becomes
much more relaxed, and you automatically try to limit acceleration so that the
display stays in Eco mode and the gasoline engine remains off -— well, maybe
that's one reason why Prius drivers are notorious for being slowpokes. I even
tested whether my large, 8 foot long surfboard would fit inside (check!) and a
new desk chair bought at Ikea could be effortlessly inserted through the
tailgate onto the enlarged loading area by folding down the seats. A
well-constructed car, I must say.

<pic images/turo-surf.ps The evaluation of a new car requires checking if my surfboard fits inside.>

How is the rental car insured with Turo now? As always, it's important to look
closely at the fine print and to understand the difference between liability
insurance and comprehensive/collision insurance. In America, liability
insurance usually stays with the car, so if, for example, we lend our car to a
friend and they have an accident, our liability insurance covers the
third-party damage -— though our premiums would likely skyrocket afterwards. If
a private individual rents out their car on Turo, their liability insurance
generally puts a stop to it, as commercial car rental is usually explicitly
excluded in the contract. However, Turo has taken precautions and arranged a
group insurance policy with a major American insurer (Liberty Mutual), which
provides liability coverage of one million dollars for each car rented through
Turo.

<pic images/prius-driver.ps Prius driver Michael is clearly having fun saving gas.>

Interestingly, Turo also offers renters various insurance packages that
primarily regulate the deductible for comprehensive insurance but allegedly
also affect liability, which varies depending on the package between one
million dollars and the much lower state-mandated minimum (in California, for
example, only $15,000 per person for personal injury, $30,000 per accident, and
$5,000 for property damage). The whole thing smells like total insurance chaos
because, in the event of an accident, up to four different insurers could be
involved: the liability insurance of the owner, Turo's group insurance, the
renter's liability insurance (if they have one for their private car that also
covers rental cars), and the comprehensive insurance package the renter may
have purchased from Turo. In the event of an accident, the renter can
undoubtedly expect a few rounds of rigamarole on the phone. On the
other hand, the comprehensive insurance, which covers damages to the rental
car, costs between 18% and 80% of the rental price, depending on the
deductible. At 18%, the renter has to pay $3,000 out of pocket for car damage
before the insurance kicks in. At 80%, the insurance covers everything, but
this option is only available for vehicles that cost less than $35,000.

We were very satisfied with our rental; even driving in traffic jams is fun with
the Prius because it automatically decelerates slightly and charges the battery
with the energy gained when you simply take your foot off the gas pedal,
without having to constantly step on the brake when the car in front is driving
erratically. However, the colorful graphic display on the dashboard probably
leads Prius drivers to accelerate very slowly to keep the Eco-Meter in the
green zone -- which likely contributes to the aforementioned slowpoke image.
But if you step on it properly, it does have some power; after all, 99
horsepower is nothing to sneeze at.

<pic images/turo-tesla-drive.ps Michael at the Tesla wheel casually overtaking an Audi on Highway 1.>

For our second Turo trip, I booked a Tesla Model 3. With the 100 miles included
in the price, I planned a route heading north over the Golden Gate Bridge, then
down the winding mountain road to Muir Beach, where we did a short hike. Then
we went up to Point Reyes Station for lunch, over to Nicasio to our favorite
cheese factory, and back over the bridge into the city. That was 90 miles, and
the Tesla's battery indicator went from 66% to 30%. The little car has "only"
270 horsepower, but it accelerates completely linearly and so strongly that you
feel pressed against the seat like on a roller coaster. I left a series of
German luxury sports cars in the dust.

<pic images/turo-tesla-wash.ps With the Tesla in the car wash. How do you put it in 'N'?>

Before driving a Tesla, you should definitely watch a few explanatory videos.
An average person might not even be able to open the driver's door with its
quirky door handle. Once in the driver's seat, you look for the gear lever and
find out that Tesla has repurposed the windshield wiper lever to the right of
the steering wheel as the gear lever: pull up to go in reverse, push down to go
forward. You turn on the windshield wipers on the tablet in the center console
by swiping and tapping through menus. You press the gear lever down twice to
activate the autopilot, which maintains the distance to the car in front and
keeps the lane on the freeway. This function even initiates overtaking on its
own when you activate the turn signal, but I found that too risky to try out
in traffic. Before
returning the vehicle, the owner wanted me to take the Tesla through an
automatic car wash, and when I got there, I suddenly remembered that you have
to put it in "N" for Neutral (i.e., neutral gear), but how do you do that with
a lever that only has "R" for Reverse and "D" for Drive? Luckily, I saw a car
wash attendant in front of the already dangerously rotating brush, and I rolled
down the window and quickly asked how to put a Tesla in "N." He was familiar
with the problem and simply reached in, pulled the lever just a bit, not all
the way down, and waited two seconds until the tablet displayed "N." You have
to figure that out first!

@Z: Valley of Fire

<pic images/vof-picnic-rock.ps This red rock provides shade for exactly one picnic table.>

<em>Angelika</em> Since we have been living in the US, I have grown very fond
of the so-called "State Parks." Many are as spectacular as the famous National
Parks, but often not as crowded and more manageable. In the US, National Parks
are managed by federal authorities, while the "State Parks" are under the
supervision of the respective state. California alone has 280 State Parks and
was one of the states that early on promoted nature conservation with the help
of the State Park system. The California Gold Rush, during which many
landscapes were ruthlessly defaced and exploited to mine gold, led to land in
Yosemite Valley being placed under protection as early as 1864, with the goal
of preserving the land and making it available to the public for recreational
purposes.

<pic images/vof-climber.ps Michael poses as a climber in the Valley of Fire.>

Now there are not only "State Parks" in California, but also in Nevada. And
when we were in Las Vegas again recently, we took a day trip to the "Valley of
Fire," the oldest and largest state park in Nevada. We had already visited this
park in 2003 and had long planned to visit it again for some hiking. Since the
park is only 50 miles northeast of Las Vegas and this time we were touring
in the not-so-scorching month of October, we left the Strip with its casinos
behind for a day and drove into nature with our rental car. In summer, it is
not advisable to hike in the park because the average temperatures are at least
100 degrees Fahrenheit, but they can also climb to a scorching 120 degrees.

<pic images/vof-sign.ps In the hellish heat of the Valley of Fire, one must be careful.>

Whoever hikes must be well-nourished, so we got ourselves a hearty sandwich in
the little town of Overton, which is just around the corner from the "Valley of
Fire." We got it from a shop with the lovely name "The Inside Scoop." The
"Scoop" refers to an ice cream scoop, as the establishment offered not only
savory sandwiches but also homemade ice cream. My sandwich was so thickly
filled that I could barely fit it in my mouth later, an unmistakable sign that
we were in the middle of nowhere, where food portions seem to grow in
proportion to the non-existent population density.

<pic images/vof-petrified.ps A petrified tree in the Valley of Fire near Las Vegas.>

In the park, we first paid the entrance fee of 10 dollars per car through a
self-payment system. At the park entrance, visitors grab a small envelope
provided by the park authority from a brown mailbox-like device. Then, they
usually write their name, car license plate number, and the date of the visit
on the front of the envelope (hoping that the provided pen works), put 10
dollars in the envelope (yes, sometimes you still need exact cash even in the
US), seal the envelope, and tear off the small control slip from the envelope,
which is then placed visibly on the car's dashboard after the money-filled
envelope is deposited in the slot of the mailbox-like device. After this
bureaucratic act, we needed to some nourishment and found a cozy spot at a
picnic table under a huge rock that provided nice shade in the dry desert
landscape. We ate our sandwiches, which immediately attracted dozens of small
ground squirrels from their holes, hoping for crumbs and other treats.

<pic images/vof-wave.ps "The Wave", a landmark in the Valley of Fire.>

In the park, we then took two beautiful hikes: "White Domes" and "Fire Wave,"
to enjoy the park's beauties. The Valley of Fire is characterized by stunning
red sandstone formations. These were formed 150 million years ago through the
complex movements of large sand dunes. Although there were actually quite a few
visitors in the park, we again experienced that we were quickly almost alone on
the hiking trails, as many of the tourists just got out of their cars, quickly
took a few photos with their phones, and then drove off again. The real beauty
of hiking the trails is discovering new unique sandstone formations that change
color with the varying positions of the sun. What fascinates me the most is the
silence in the desert, as it is neither quiet nor calm in San Francisco nor at
my job in the school. The second hike led us through the desert landscape to a
huge rock formation that looked like a large, rippling wave. It was as if water
had turned into stone with reddish, brown, and beige color shades. Uniquely
beautiful!

@Z: Las Vegas for Pros

<pic images/lv-neon-park-1.ps Two professional tourists at the Neon Museum in Las Vegas.>

<em>Michael</em> Las Vegas is a must-see for German tourists, but for us, it is
a special place because we met in Las Vegas for the first time, ages ago. We go
there from time to time to refresh our memories and to see what has changed in
this city of madness since our last visit. And there is always something going
on.

And of course, Las Vegas is a tourist trap like no other, but our trick is to
move like locals. This starts right after landing at the airport, when tourists
stand in line for hours at the Alamo or Budget counters to get a rental car,
while we simply jump into our Hertz car and drive off. Then, we don't head
straight to the booked hotel on the Strip, but instead go directly to a large
supermarket where we buy bottled mineral water and other drinks in bulk. Casino
hotels only sell drinks in the minibar or small shops at exorbitant prices; you
can't get bottled water there for less than five or six dollars. Leaving the
casino is extremely annoying, as you have to walk miles to the nearest store.

<pic images/lv-self-parking.ps Professionals park on the left, amateurs on the right.>

When parking the rental car, we prefer so-called self-parking in hotel garages
like those at the Encore or Vdara. Valet parking, where a hotel attendant parks
the car, is a completely idiotic concept, even if the hotel offers it for free.
When you need the car again, you end up standing around dumbly at the entrance
until the attendant finally retrieves the rental car from the garage, and you
have to tip him for it! We simply roll our rolling luggage from the
self-parking garage to the hotel reception, check in, and that's it. When we
need the car, we just get in and drive off. By the way, if you're only staying
within city limits, there's no need to book a rental car at all; you're better
off using Uber and Lyft. But we like to drive around in nearby areas.

<pic images/lv-sundries.ps Caution: These shops in the casino sell drinks at exorbitant prices.>

When dining out, the rule is: People who have traveled from all over America
don't care at all about the cost, because those who only have a diner at home,
where people sit with baseball caps on, are happy to spend a construction
worker's weekly wage on a rather mediocre dinner, as long as it's served on
expensive linen and bustling waiters are hovering between the tables.
Restaurants in casinos on the Strip are generally about twice as expensive as
in a city with a wide selection of restaurants. Those looking for a better
price/performance ratio are better off in one of the trendy restaurants west of
the Strip, although the more established places there are also charging
quite hefty prices nowadays.

When it comes to hotel prices, it should be noted that practically all major
hotels on the Strip add an absurd rip-off fee of about $45 per day, which they
call "Resort Fee" (<RBLINK>20161030#4</RBLINK>). No upright
person can justify it without bursting into laughter. Classic rip-off, you just
have to add it to the room price. It's astonishing that this criminal behavior
hasn't been prosecuted yet, but maybe in ten years there will be a class action
lawsuit, and all those who were ripped off will get their money back from the
casino criminals, one can only hope. It's also important to note that the
nights from Friday/Saturday and Saturday/Sunday are about twice as expensive as
all the others. So, if you can postpone your visit by a day, you might save
some real money.

It should be noted, however, that the casino tricksters are very cunning and
always come up with new ways to take people's hard-earned money. On the next
visit, everything will definitely be even more expensive again!

@Z: Video Poker

<pic images/lv-straight-flush.ps Angelika won 50 dollars by getting a straight flush in video poker.>

<em>Michael</em> Gambling in the casino is the main attraction for many
visitors in Las Vegas. Some save up all year just to let loose at the blackjack
or craps table for a few hours -— and then go home without any money left. We also like
to spend some time in the casino, but not just because of the slot machines;
it's because human dramas unfold there that can only happen at a casino. During
our last visit, we overheard a couple where the woman confessed to the man that
she felt guilty about blowing her grandmother's gift money and wondered if she
should rather invest it in a tank of gas for the car. No, no, the man said,
after all, it was her money now and she could spend it however she wanted!

We are not big gamblers, but we are fascinated by the somewhat outdated video
poker machines. We play by some simple rules that allow us to get back 99% of
our stake, and while we play, the casino waitresses serve us high-quality
alcoholic drinks for free, for which we only tip the waitress about one to two
dollars each time.

<pic images/winpoker-1.ps Oops, Michael made a mistake and didn't play optimally.>

I have already described the video poker strategy before
(<RBLINK>20090315#12</RBLINK>), so just a brief recap: The goal is to keep the
right cards from the five initially dealt cards and exchange the rest once, in
order to form a good poker hand: a high pair, a full house, a straight, or even
a royal flush. Depending on the value of the hand, the machine then pays out
the winnings or remains silent. Using probability calculations, one can
determine which cards to keep from a given hand for the highest possible chance
of winning and which to exchange. For each situation, mathematics prescribes
the "correct" move, but keeping all the individual rules in mind is not quite
simple.

<pic images/winpoker-2.ps Speculating on a straight and holding four cards is by far the best choice here.>

But with some practice, you can achieve about a 99% payout rate; really savvy
pros can even reach 99.5% -- so the casino always wins 50 cents for every
hundred dollars wagered, which is more than worth the alcohol-fueled fun. If
you want to test at home whether you have mastered the rules, I recommend the
smartphone app "Winpoker," which not only accurately simulates the slot game
but also issues warnings if the player should have chosen different cards than
the ones clicked. The app even calculates how much each playing error costs,
down to the last cent, and mathematically inclined individuals can compare the
winning probabilities of different moves. That brings out the inner child in
every man.

@Z: Las Vegas Neon Museum

<pic images/lv-neon-outside.ps Behind thick walls, beautiful old neon signs are stored.>

<em>Angelika</em> When it comes to Las Vegas, we understandably get
sentimental. Sometimes we really miss the old Las Vegas. After all, back then
we used to go there as students to eat cheaply and abundantly at the "All You
Can Eat" buffets, to snag an affordable rental car, and then to dash off to the
various national parks. Las Vegas has reinvented itself many times since our
first encounter there, but for us, the city is enveloped in nostalgia because
that's where we met. We never tire of seeking that feeling during our visits.

<pic images/lv-neon-angelika.ps The Neon Museum displays all kinds of colorful, glamorous advertising signs that shine beautifully in the evening light.>

At the "Neon Museum," we got our money's worth this time. Anyone who has ever
been to Las Vegas knows that colorful, oversized neon signs follow you at every
turn, sparkling and blinking. In Las Vegas, the lights seem to never go out.
Many of these neon signs have achieved a certain iconic status, either because
they have a particularly beautiful or controversial design, or because they
belonged to a casino that no longer exists but once held an important place in
the history of Las Vegas.

<pic images/lv-neon-park-2.ps The statue of this billiard player used to advertise a pool billiards salon.>

The <LINK>https://www.neonmuseum.org|Neon Museum</LINK> was founded in 1996 for
the purpose of preserving these old signs and making them accessible to the
public. The open-air exhibit displays them outside in the so-called "Boneyard,"
and visitors walk through the laid-out paths and can admire the neon signs set
up at ground level. The sun beats down mercilessly from the sky, as Las Vegas
is known to be in the desert, and there is no shade in the open-air settings.
We arrived at the museum in the late afternoon because the sun then made the
neon signs appear in a particularly beautiful light.

<pic images/lv-neon-milk.ps The milkman's advertising sign in the neon museum.>

The idea for the museum came about when the famous casino and hotel "The Sands"
closed in 1996, and no one knew what to do with the historic and oversized
"Sands" sign. Unfortunately, it ended up in the trash. The friendly museum
staff explained to us that the size of the signs often poses a problem, as
dismantling and transportation are costly.

<pic images/lv-neon-park-3.ps Air guitar artist Michael in front of the 20-meter-high Gibson Les Paul, the centerpiece of the Neon Museum.>

The "Young Electric Sign Company" (YESCO), based in Salt Lake City, Utah, was
the original manufacturer of many of these signs and is still considered a
leader in the industry today. The Neon Museum now houses many well-known signs,
such as those from the casinos "Stardust," "Aladdin," "Riviera," and "Sahara."
However, I particularly liked the lesser-known ones, such as a little milkman
figure delivering milk. The museum charges $30 per person for admission. You are
only allowed to take photos with your phone or tablet. Despite the high
admission price, we highly recommend a visit to the museum.

@Z: Drinking water at SFO airport

<pic images/sfo-water-byob.ps At SFO airport, there are no more plastic water bottles.>

<em>Michael</em> Air travelers often get so thirsty on long-haul flights that
flight attendants can hardly keep up with refilling drinks. Therefore, it is
advisable to carry bottled water. But, oh dear, unfortunately, airport
security does not allow liquids to be brought through, so it has become
customary for travelers to quickly purchase a plastic bottle of water at the
gate area at an exorbitant price. Did I say plastic?! For heaven's sake,
plastic waste is no longer acceptable in green San Francisco!

<pic images/sfo-water-refill.ps At the "Hydration Station," travelers fill their brought bottles with filtered tap water.>

Drinking American chlorinated tap water is also not everyone's cup of tea, and
that's why the operators of the newly redesigned Terminal 1 at SFO Airport,
which has recently been named "Harvey Milk Terminal" after the well-known gay
activist from the 70s (<RBLINK>20060720#8</RBLINK>), installed so-called
"hydration stations", where passengers can fill their own containers
with Brita-filtered tap water. To prevent anyone from placing the rim of their
bottle, which might be contaminated with germs, directly on the spout, the
stations activate the water stream using a light sensor when a container is
held under an upward-facing hole in the chrome frame of the station.

<pic images/sfo-water-bottle.ps The kiosk sells these reusable bottles for five dollars.>

Anyone who has forgotten to bring their own bottle can purchase pre-filled
reusable bottles with water at the kiosk for four or five dollars, available in
two different sizes. By the way, the filling machine looked strangely familiar
to me: in our fitness center at Apple, where no plastic bottles are distributed
anymore, there is exactly the same unit from the company "Elkay." With this,
San Francisco officially enters the heavenly realm of environmental angels.

@Z: Trump's re-election 2020

<pic images/election-2016.ps Trump won the election in 2016. Will he be re-elected in 2020? Source: Wikipedia>

<em>Angelika</em> In the last newsletter, I promised to explain why we have
great concerns that Trump might get re-elected. As I said, I would be very happy
if my prediction turns out to be wrong. But why do I hold this opinion? It is
true that a lot can happen before the actual election date in November 2020,
but anyone who thinks that Trump will be removed from office is living in a
fantasy world, because the Republican-dominated Senate will never turn its back
on Trump.

However, one of the glaring mistakes of the Democratic candidates is that they
are aiming for a revolution instead of focusing on preventing Trump's
re-election. Ultimately, everything boils down to the Democratic base and the
American electoral system. The base wants to see a radical change in direction
after four years of Trump. Therefore, they are backing candidates like
Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who advocate more left-leaning ideas by
American standards. One such idea is to replace private health insurance, which
many receive through their employers, with a state-managed health insurance
system. Additionally, Elizabeth Warren has set a goal to break up large and
powerful companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook to curb their influence.

To secure the nomination for the Democratic Party, Warren and her team must win
the primaries in the individual states. In these primaries, die-hard Democrats
cast their votes, typically those who want a revolution. Currently, in some
states like Iowa or New Hampshire, which hold their primaries first, Elizabeth
Warren is leading according to polls, closely followed by Bernie Sanders. On a
national level, however, Joe Biden is still the frontrunner. The problem now is
that if Joe Biden does not win the primaries in the early-voting states, the
entire election machinery can take on a life of its own, and campaign donations
are more likely to flow to the winners. Consequently, the field of Democratic
candidates may thin out because many simply run out of money.

The problem with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, is
that if they were to run against Trump, they would need votes from independents
and moderate voters to win the so-called "swing states," which are the states
that sometimes go to the Democratic candidate and other times to the Republican
candidate. Without these states, no candidate can become president due to the
electoral college system, as it is not enough to have the majority of the
direct votes. Unfortunately, Joe Biden has not exactly shone in the debates.
Now, the former mayor of New York has also entered the race for the Democrats:
Mike Bloomberg, who is considered pragmatic and moderate and, above all, has
enough money to finance his own campaign. Many believe that he thought about
this too late and, moreover, could take votes away from Joe Biden. A drama
without end, which will hopefully not end in a catastrophe.

Greetings from the land of crazy politics:

Angelika and Michael
