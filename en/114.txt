<em>Angelika</em> 
Only two days until Christmas, and it's high time to send out the
Christmas newsletter. As always, the year has passed too quickly.
Wasn't it just summer? We weren't very diligent newsletter writers in
2015, but we promise to do better in the new year.

It seems as though the world has become a bit unhinged. Thousands of
people are on the run, and in the USA, there is an ugly election
campaign. Never before have there been as many mass shootings and
rampages in the USA as in 2015. However, the topic is so heated that
it seems impossible to discuss it. So I thought, why not let the
numbers speak for themselves, because Christmas is also a time for
reflection. In this spirit, <em>Peace on Earth</em>, and we wish a Merry Christmas
to all of our loyal readers!
Christmas!
