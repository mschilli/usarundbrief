@Z: Christmas 2004

<pic images/usamaps.ps Our very special map of America>

After the map of America lit up in blue and red in November to
illustrate the election results, today we present our very own
personal map. Before and after the election, there was much
discussion about how divided the country is. Some observers even
claimed that a cultural battle is raging within America: the liberal
"blue" states against the conservative "red" heartland, with no
agreement in sight.

We, on the other hand, tested what comes to our mind for each of the
states. The map shows you which American states we have already
visited. "Green" means that we have both been there. "Blue" indicates
that only Michael has been there, and yellow (yes, that's right,
there aren't any) only I have; in the white ones, neither of us has
been. By the way, stays at various airports in America don't count.
We noticed that for some states, absolutely nothing comes to mind.
Michael even had trouble remembering which ones he had driven through
back when he and his buddy were delivering cars from one place to
another to travel cheaply. So if you get bored over the holidays, you
can play the game: What comes to mind for each American state? In
this spirit, we wish you all a Merry Christmas!

@Z: Comments on all U.S. States

<em>Washington State (went to Kerry).</em> 
State in the Northwest, not to be confused with the capital of the
USA, Washington, D.C., which is 5,000 kilometers away in the East.
The city of Seattle is surprisingly considered the coffee city of the
USA. The coffeehouse chain "Starbucks" also started in Seattle, and
quite modestly at that. Legend has it that a Starbucks guru traveled
to Italy and was so impressed by the Italian espresso bars that he
wanted to bring them to America. And since Americans tend to go "all
or nothing," tourists can now find a "Starbucks" everywhere in the
country. Ahhhhh!!!!!

<em>Oregon (went to Kerry)</em> 
Historical mistake by O'Reilly to move the Perl Conference from sunny
San Diego, California to sleepy Portland, Oregon. According to our
own surveys, the suburbs of Portland seem to have the highest
concentration of the coffeehouse chain "Starbucks." In Oregon, voting
is done exclusively by mail.

<em>California (went to Kerry)</em> 
The most populous state in the USA, which belonged to Mexico until
1847 and is now home to a diverse mix of people, so that soon whites
will be in the minority. Californians tend to elevate actors to
political offices, such as Ronald Reagan (former Governor of
California), Clint Eastwood (former Mayor of Carmel), and Arnold
Schwarzenegger (current Governor of California). And, of course, San
Francisco is located here, one of the most beautiful and liberal
cities in the world.

<em>Alaska (went to Bush)"</em> 
Located high in the north, separated from the rest of the USA by
Canada, it only became the 49th state in 1959. A harsh shortage of
women, home to mostly lonely oil drillers with high salaries. On the map, it was
only drawn at the bottom for space reasons (like Hawaii). Alaska is
at the top of our "Must-Visit" list.

<em>Hawaii (went to Kerry)</em>
The seven islands were only added as the 50th state in 1959. A
paradise where people speak English and pay in dollars. Since Hawaii
is only a 5-hour flight from San Francisco, it is a popular travel
destination for many Californians (including us).

<em>Idaho (went to Bush)</em>
Potato State.

<em>Montana (went to Bush)"</em> 
Until 1999, there was no speed limit in Montana. However, the roads
are so bad that any car would simply desintegrate if you drove faster than 65 miles
per hour. Posh Hollywood stars buy huge properties there with vacation
homes in the mountainous area.

<em>Wyoming (went to Bush)</em> 
Why... should I care about this?

<em>Nevada (went to Bush)</em> 
Allows widespread gambling, prostitution, and people smoking like
chimneys. A fitting movie: "Leaving Las Vegas" with Nicolas Cage. In
the car rental company "Brooks Rent-A-Car" in Las Vegas, a historic
event took place in 1987: Angelika and Michael met each other for the first time.

<em>Utah (went to Bush)</em> 
Mormon stronghold. Despite the persistent prejudice that the Mormon
Church allows polygamy, it was abolished as early as 1890: a key
requirement for Utah's admission into the United States. However, it
is true that in the vast expanses of this state, a small group of
religious fundamentalists are living the illegal lifestyle of polygamy.

The claim that there isn't a drop of alcohol to drink in Utah is not
true. In "liquor stores" (wine and spirits shops), which are closed
on Sundays, as well as in bars and restaurants, you can certainly
enjoy a drink. However, supermarkets are only allowed to sell
low-alcohol beer (3.2% alcohol content). Utah is also the state of
gigantic national parks: Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Zion,
Monument Valley. Stunningly beautiful.

<em>Arizona (went to Bush)</em> 
Home of the Grand Canyon: A highlight of any trip to the American
West. Recently, a book titled "Grand Canyon - A Different View" was
on sale in the national park's tourist shop. The author, Tom Vail,
is a so-called "Creationist," meaning someone who takes the biblical
account of the creation of the Earth literally. He believes that the
Grand Canyon was formed as a result of Noah's Flood. There are things
that are just unbelievable.

<em>Colorado (went to Bush)"</em> 
In Colorado lies the college town of "Boulder." In 1987, I (Angelika)
went there with my travel companion and a few Americans to eat pizza.
My friend greeted the staff at the pizzeria cheerfully: "Hi, gays!"
This caused them to burst into loud laughter because "gays" means
"homosexuals," as the Americans in our group immediately explained to us. Of
course, she meant to say: "Hi, guys!" (= Hello, folks!). We laughed
so much!

<em>New Mexico (went to Bush)</em> 
The state of New Mexico is increasingly developing into an artist hub,
particularly the city of Santa Fe, which is on the travel itinerary
of many art enthusiasts, photographers, esotericists, and old
hippies.

<em>North Dakota (went to Bush)</em> 
North of South Dakota.

<em>South Dakota (went to Bush)</em> 
The cult movie "Fargo" is set here. Middle of nowhere. Winter as cold
as in Russia, and the people say "Jaa" instead of "Yes".

<em>The phrase "Nebraska (ging an Bush)" is in German. Translated to
English, it means "Nebraska (went to Bush)." This likely refers to an
election context where the state of Nebraska was won by a candidate
with the last name Bush.</em> 
I never know if that's an American state or a Canadian one. Now I
know.
<em>The phrase "Kansas (ging an Bush)" appears to be a mix of English
and German. In German, "ging an" can mean "went to" or "approached."
However, without additional context, it's difficult to provide an
accurate translation. If "Bush" refers to a person, such as a member
of the Bush family, the translation could be "Kansas went to Bush" or
"Kansas approached Bush." If you have more context, I can offer a
more precise translation.</em> 

The journalist Thomas Frank attempts to explain in his recently
published book "What's the Matter with Kansas?" why the people in his
home state of Kansas have sided with the Republicans, essentially
voting against their own economic and social interests. Recommended
reading!
<em>The phrase "Oklahoma (ging an Bush)" appears to be a mix of
English and German. "Ging an" in German can mean "went to" or "went
on." However, without additional context, it's difficult to provide
an accurate translation. If "Bush" refers to a person, such as a
member of the Bush family, the translation could be "Oklahoma (went
to Bush)" or "Oklahoma (went on Bush)." More context would help
clarify the intended meaning.</em> 
Timothy McVeigh became known for building bombs, blowing up the
federal building in Oklahoma City, being captured, and executed.
<em>The phrase "Texas (ging an Bush)" appears to be a mix of English
and German. In German, "ging an" can mean "went to" or "went
against," depending on the context. However, without additional
context, it's difficult to provide an accurate translation. If it is
meant to say "Texas went to Bush," it could refer to an election
result where Texas supported Bush. If it is "Texas went against
Bush," it could imply opposition. Please provide more context for a
precise translation.</em> 
Home of George Bush I and II, BBQ, and ZZ Top. However, neither Bush
I (born in Milton, Massachusetts) nor II (born in New Haven,
Connecticut) were born in Texas; they are true East Coast elites who
were drawn to the cowboy state by the oil industry. Texas allows
loaded weapons in the glove compartment.
<em>The phrase "Minnesota (ging an Kerry)" appears to be a mix of
English and another language, possibly Irish. "Minnesota" is already
in English, and "ging an Kerry" seems to be a phrase in Irish.
However, "ging an Kerry" does not directly translate to a coherent
phrase in English. It might be a misspelling or a phrase that
requires more context to accurately translate. Could you provide more
context or check the spelling?</em> 

The hometown of the artist formerly known as "Prince," who comes from
Minneapolis (St. Paul). Otherwise, there's not much going on there.

Moines, Iowa." While business trips to America were generally very
popular, people came up with creative excuses to avoid having to go
there a second time.
<em>The phrase "Wisconsin (ging an Kerry)" appears to be a mix of
English and German. In this context, "ging an" is German and can be
translated to "went to" or "went for." Therefore, the translation
could be "Wisconsin went to Kerry" or "Wisconsin went for Kerry,"
depending on the context. If this is referring to an election or a
similar event, it might mean that Wisconsin supported or voted for
Kerry.</em> 
Too cold in the winter and too warm in the summer. There is actually
a place called 'Tomahawk'.

<em>It seems like there might be a typo or some confusion in the text
you provided. "Illinois" is already in English, and "ging an Kerry"
doesn't appear to be a phrase in another language that can be
directly translated to English. Could you please provide more context
or clarify the text?</em> 
Chicago is here. And also, as attentive viewers of the cult film
"Wayne's World" know, the city of Aurora. I still remember a scene
from the film: Wayne grabs a Gibson in a guitar store and starts to
strum a famous Led Zeppelin tune on it. The salesman yells, "Hey!"
and points to a sign that actually says "NO STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN.

<em>went to Bush However, without additional context, it's unclear
what "Bush" refers to in this context. It could be a surname, a
reference to a bush or shrub, or something else entirely.</em> 
It has a "foolish image," similar to East Frisia. Bill Clinton was

pronounced "Ar-kan-sas," but (no joke!) "Ar-kin-saw" (emphasis on the
first syllable).
<em>The phrase "Louisiana (ging an Bush)" appears to be a mix of
English and German. In German, "ging an" can mean "went to" or "went

<em>The phrase "Tennessee (ging an Bush)" seems to be a mix of

mean something specific in a regional or colloquial context. However,

translation. If you meant something specific, could you please
provide more details or clarify the context?</em> 

Tiny East Coast state, the Liechtenstein of America.

<em>The phrase "Florida (ging an Bush)" appears to be a mix of
English and German. In this context, "ging an" is German and can be

This might refer to an event or situation where Florida supported or
was associated with someone named Bush, possibly in a political
context.</em>
