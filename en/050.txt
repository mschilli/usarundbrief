@Z: The Speedo Trap

<pic images/l1.ps Long short pants>

<em>Michael</em> Americans find
the typical swimwear worn by German tourists hilarious.
I was not aware of this fact for a long time and often went
swimming in the typical German and tight swimsuits, called "speedos" here
in America. I received many strange looks.

What I didn't know was that heterosexual Americans never wear anything skimpier
than boxershorts. Anything else may be fashionable on hot days at Dolores Park
in San Francisco, where the toned men of the gay scene bask in the sun. But it
would never occur to the average American to wear a tight-fitting swimsuit.

<pic images/dolores.ps At Dolores Park, mainly good-looking men are sunbathing.>

Also, even the shorts for men are longer in the US than in Europe. For
heterosexual men, it's almost all the way to the knee, if not longer. I would
draw the line at a hand's breadth above the knee. In San Francisco's Castro
district, around our corner, you can also often see slightly more revealing
clothing pieces, like hotpants, but only for those who like it!

In predominantly American-populated tourist destinations such as Hawaii, where
few Germans wander, it is a hilarious sight to observe self-confidently
striding typically-German (tm) in speedos on the beach who have not yet gotten
the memo! Even Linux creator Linus Torvalds, who has been
living in America for a long time, seems to be unaware of this fact, as the
pictures from the
<LINK>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGvFzPO6jW4|Linus Dunk</LINK> prove.
Granted, it's not easy to figure this out coming from Germany. But once you have,
it's quite hilarious!

@Z: Fight against obesity: The Atkins Diet

<pic images/atkins2.ps Fast food chain "Subway" offers an "Atkins-friendly" menu with salads and sandwiches.>
 
<em>Angelika</em> Europeans have always scoffed at the fat Americans. That 2/3
of the American population struggles with being overweight and 1/3 are
medically considered obese is no secret here in the USA either.

Nowadays, there are increasingly fatter children because kids eat too much
fast food and hang out in front of the TV and computer for hours. That children
develop juvenile diabetes due to bad eating habits can almost be called a
trend. Desperate parents therefore initially tried to sue McDonald's, since the
fast food chain did not clearly warn of the health risks of its product range.
This typical American way of dragging everyone to court still seems absurd to
us.

Even the diet craze is not new. Every American book store has an impressive
selection of books that are meant to help reduce excessive pounds. Then there
are the various talk shows that present dramatic success stories: people who
suddenly fit into their old pants three times, smiling happily into the camera.
Lately, you can also find entertainment shows in which a whole group fights
their excessive weight together and is accompanied by television cameras for
months.

There is no shortage of theories as to why Americans are gaining more and more
weight. There is a preference for large portions and fast food. Unhealthy food
is cheaper than healthy food (which is true). No time to cook healthier meals,
lack of exercise, too much fat in the meals, too many carbohydrates. And on the
packaging of each product, there are indications of calories, carbohydrates,
etc. printed - but these always refer to a so-called "serving size", not to the
entire package. So if someone eats the whole bag of chips, they wonder why they
are consuming ten times the amount of calories!

The fear of high fat content in food led to a boom in reduced-fat products
here. In every American supermarket you can find low-fat chips, cookies and the
like. It happens to me from time to time that I grab the wrong - reduced-fat -
bag. A misery, because the stuff simply tastes artificial and usually ends up
in the trash can with us. My motto is: When eating chips, then the right ones.

<pic images/atkins4.ps Low-Carb Cookies: 120 Calories, 9 Net Carbs per "Serving Size".>

But I always get the real crisis when standing in front of the shelf with the
dairy products.  You almost need telepathic abilities to find the full-fat
yoghurt or the full-fat milk. There is usually only one kind of the "full-fat
variant". Everything else is low-fat or non-fat. Now I know that this trend has
now also infected Germany. I just pray fervently that my German favorite
potato chips will be spared.

For some time now, America has been in the second phase of its fight against
obesity. No longer is fat the focus of the debate, but rather the "evil"
carbohydrates. The blame for this lies with American doctor Robert Atkins, who
more than 30 years ago caused nutritionists around the world to scoff at
his low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Atkins assumes that the consumption of
carbohydrates stimulates insulin production, which can not only lead to
stronger feelings of hunger but also to fat storage. On the other hand, if one
abstains from bread, pasta, rice and highly sugary drinks, etc., the body will
in turn burn fat.

Critics of the Atkins diet don't necessarily dispute this, but they are
disturbed by the allowed consumption of foods with a high fat content due to
the increased risk of heart disease. However, the fact is that most people lose
weight with Atkins. Many nutritionists, however, attribute the weight loss to
the reduced calorie intake under the Atkins diet.

Nevertheless: Atkins has been on everyone's lips for the past 2-3 years. I know
some followers of the diet, which you can always tell because there is no bread
on their plate. The popularity of this low-carbohydrate diet was not affected
by the death of Robert Atkins in 2003, which was accompanied by malicious
rumors. It was rumored that Atkins was overweight at the time of his death and
had a few extra pounds.

In any case, the pragmatic American businessmen smell ringing cash registers
with the Atkins fans. Several restaurant and fast food chains have already
adapted to these customers. So there are Atkins-friendly menus at "Subway" and
"TGI Friday's" ("Thank God it's Friday). For example, the New York steak with
blue cheese crumbles is only 6 carbohydrates at TGI Friday's. From now on,
customers at Burger King can also happily bite into a hamburger without a bun,
the minced meat patty is held together by a lettuce leaf.

<pic images/atkins3.ps Even ice cream on a stick is available as a low-carb product with an Atkins label.>

Even manufacturers of various spirits are now advertising that their high-proof
distillates contain no carbohydrates! In addition, more and more products with
reduced carbohydrate content are quietly and secretly entering American
supermarkets. According to the magazine Consumer Reports, there are now 930
such products on the American market: beer, ice cream, cookies, cake -
everything the heart desires. They then have such nice names like "Atkins
Endulge" or "Carb Smart".

Even Coca-Cola is coming out with a new cola variety this summer that contains
fewer carbohydrates. Usually, sugar is replaced by sugar alcohols or
fermented carbohydrates, which allegedly stimulate insulin production in the
body less than regular sugar. The packaging of the "low-carb" (=low
carbohydrate) products then advertises how many carbohydrates are hidden in the
product, although the current American food law does not yet define what is
considered low.

Generally, few carbohydrates in a product does not necessarily mean few
calories. The idea that it is okay to indulge in low-carb cookies does not hold
up. What I find interesting about the whole carbohydrate story is that the
country is again following the motto "all or nothing". Americans tend to be a bit
extreme in this regard. We already saw this in the fight against smokers in
California (now you can't even smoke on the beach in Santa Monica). And once
they had set their sights on the enemy "carbohydrates", there was no stopping
them.

@Z: The United States Postal Service (USPS)

<pic images/mailbox.ps (#1) Typical mailboxes. The red signal indicates that the resident placed a postage-paid item for the postman to take away.>

<em>Michael</em> "Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds."
This is the official
<LINK>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service_creed|motto of the United States Postal Service</LINK>
(no joke!). The motto is borrowed from the ancient Greeks, 430 BC. The Greek
historian Herodotus wrote this sentence about the riding messengers of Xerxes,
the King of Persia.

Mail carriers don't enjoy the best reputation here in America. In the TV series
"Seinfeld," the mailman "Newman" always calls in sick when it rains, hides bags
of undelivered mail in the basement, and claims that zip codes are meaningless.

But it has nevertheless amazing features: So a letter that does not weigh more
than 2 ounces (32g) costs only 37 cents, no matter where to be delivered in the
entire USA, even to Hawaii or Alaska. For heavier shipments, price depends on
the distance to be covered.

In Figure (#1) you can see typical American mailboxes. They are not locked,
anyone can open the flap. When the postman comes, he opens the flap and puts
the mail in.

In inner cities, there are also often mailboxes that look like their German
counterparts, but are simply holes in the wall, and the mail simply falls
inside the house after being dropped in.

<HTMLONLY><pic images/kasten.ps A mailbox directly into the house.></HTMLONLY>

In suburbs or rural areas, the mailman drives through the area in a
right-hand-steered car. Cars with the steering wheel on the right side are
usually only found in countries with left-hand traffic, but this special
construction has the advantage in the US that the mailman can pull up to the
right side and throw the mail into the mailbox without getting out of the car.
Sitting on the right side in the front of the car, however, he can hardly see
to the left in the back, and therefore the mail car has several oversized
mirrors so that the driver can safely drive the monster from mailbox to
mailbox.

<pic images/postauto.ps The motorized postman throws the mail from the car into the mailbox.>

With the booming eBay phenomenon, more and more people are sending their junk,
which others have bid on in auctions, by mail. The usually antiquated-looking
USPS has come up with something new: on the internet, on the website usps.com,
you can create a mailing label with a barcode, print it out on paper or
self-adhesive labels with your home printer, and pay with a credit card right
away. You have to specify the exact weight and dimensions of the package, and
the USPS website shows how much postage it costs. Up to one pound it's $4.50,
up to two pounds it's $8.50 for the farthest distances within America.

With the label available through the new service, which has a printed tracking
number, you can then track it on the Internet to see where the package is and
if the lucky recipient has already received it. And USPS version of the
originally genius service invented by the private delivery company UPS doesn't
cost a cent more!

If you then drop off the package at the post office, you don't have to queue
up, but just slide it to the next clerk, because everything is already done.
Or, you just give it to the postman who is currently delivering the mail in the
neighborhood. By the way, this is common in America: The mailman not only delivers
mail, but also takes freshly stamped new mail. In big cities this is rather
unknown, because the postmen are totally stressed there, but in rural areas it
is quite normal to put the sent mail in the tube-shaped own mailbox and bend up
the red signal as shown in Figure (#1). Before the mailman then puts in the
delivered mail, he takes out the freshly stamped one that has been prepared
there and later hands it in at the post office.

For heavier packages, the "Ground" services of private delivery companies like
UPS and Fedex are cheaper than the US Postal Service. Instead of sending it by
plane, heavy cargo is sent by "Ground" shipping, i.e. by truck across the
continent, and can be tracked with a tracking number to see how the heavy iron
is carted through the individual states. A real thrill! For example, I once
sold a 50 lbs computer printer on Ebay to a gentleman in New York City, who paid
the 39 dollar Fedex postage without complaint, and after a week and 3000 miles
by truck, received the printer intact.

@Z: Credit Report

<pic images/crep.ps The independent magazine "Consumer Reports" reports on "Identity Theft".>

<em>Michael</em> In the USA, the financial activities of every citizen are
closely monitored by three private companies: Equifax, Trans Union and
Experion. I mentioned this briefly in <RBLINK>20010501#6</RBLINK>. When you
open a bank account, apply for a credit card, or take out a loan for a house --
bam! a notification goes to the three. On the other hand, when you apply for a
job with a company or show interest in renting a new apartment -- bam! the
company or landlord will ask the three about your financial situation.

Moreover, the three of them learn from every small mistake: If one forgets to
transfer the monthly payment to the credit card company just once, it will
immediately be prominently displayed in the "Credit Report". If one has 10
credit cards, two leased cars and has financed 3 houses over the last 10 years,
like the average American, this report will quickly become confusing.

Since Americans like to keep things simple, financial companies like "Fair
Isaac" generate a so-called "Credit Score", a number between 300 and 850 that
indicates a person's creditworthiness. The higher the score, the better: 300
indicates a notorious bankrupt, whom nobody would trust. However, from 720
onwards, banks swarm around the customer like moths to a light, this number
distinguishes carefully operating people whose transactions have been recorded
for some time and have never shown irregularities.

When someone wants to buy a house and applies for a loan, the bank employee
goes to the computer, retrieves the score and then offers the customer the
interest rate according to an internal table, similar to the following:

<HTMLONLY>
<table border="1"><tr><th>Credit Score</th> <th>Interest Rate</th></tr>
<tr><td>720-850</td> <td>5.73%</td></tr>
<tr><td>700-719</td> <td>5.83%</td></tr>
<tr><td>675-699</td> <td>6.39%</td></tr>
<tr><td>620-674</td> <td>7.30%</td></tr>
<tr><td>560-619</td> <td>8.66%</td></tr>
<tr><td>500-559</td> <td>9.10%</td></tr>
</table> 
</HTMLONLY>

<PRINTONLY>
\begin{tabular}[t]{p{5cm}rr}
Credit Score & Interest Rate \\ 
720-850 & 5.73% \\
700-719 & 5.83% \\
675-699 & 6.39% \\
620-674 & 7.30% \\
560-619 & 8.66% \\
500-559 & 9.10% \\
\end{tabular}
</PRINTONLY>

It pays off, therefore, to keep one's "Credit Report" in order and to know
one's "Score", which could translate into actual money. For Germans who have
recently moved to the USA, the Credit Report is simply empty, and it is not so
easy to apply for a credit card or to rent an apartment.

The "Credit Report" is kept under the Social Security Number (SSN) of a person.
Every American has one. It consists of 9 digits, in the format XXX-XX-XXXX. It
accompanies one throughout life, almost everyone knows it by heart. As an
immigrant, one is assigned an SSN when registering with the Social Security
Administration in the USA with a valid work visa (see
<RBLINK>970126#3</RBLINK>).

The SSN should be kept secret, because it also serves for identification of a
person. For example, when I call my bank, the automated voice asks me
for the last four numbers of my SSN before it reads out the account data. When
sending an application for a new credit card, the SSN must be on it.

<pic images/idt.ps (#2) A truck driver in a beauty salon? Something's not right! Citi Bank is advertising a credit card with protection against identity theft.>

In terms of data protection, one gets the bare horror. Some
health insurance companies take the SSN as a membership number and print it on
the card so that every doctor's assistant can see it. Every time I write
something for an American publisher and get paid for it, I have to submit my
SSN so that it is correctly taxed. Recently, a secretary even wanted me to send
her the SSN by email - which I had to give a lengthy lecture about how the text
of any normal email is accessible to anyone who sits at a computer somewhere
between the sender and the receiver. Even the registration form for the Costco
shopping paradise asks for the SSN, it's downright crazy!

This total devaluation of the SSN has led to the need to think very carefully
about who to actually give one's SSN to. Even if it is asked for, one sometimes
has to really say "No!" In recent years, authorities have registered a drastic
increase in "Identity Theft" crimes. If someone knows someone else's SSN and
also knows their name and address, it is very easy to open accounts, apply for
credit cards and do all kinds of mischief. The victims often don't notice this
for years until one day the rude awakening comes when unexpectedly high bills
arrive and the reputation is ruined. It often takes years for the victims to
repair the damage.

Therefore, consumer organizations and the independent magazine "Consumer
Reports" (similar to Stiftung Warentest in Germany) recommend that one should
check their "Credit Report" at least once a year with the three credit bureaus.
This costs $12.95 per bureau (so a total of $38.85) and can be quickly done
over the internet with companies like
<LINK>http://www.myfico.com|MyFico</LINK>. There, one not only has to provide
their SSN and driver's license number, but also has to answer a series of
tricky questions to ensure that they are indeed who they claim to be.

There, you can then see your Credit Score and all accounts, credit cards, and
loans you have ever applied for per credit monitoring firm. Additionally, the
website shows any irregularities and gives tips on how to increase your Credit
Score.

For example, if one has never taken out a loan, one should simply apply for a
small one for fun, pay it back properly, and the score will increase. However,
if one asks for the credit report too often, this will reduce the score, so be
careful!

Since the process works for three companies independently, it is important to check
all three to make sure that no mistakes have been made that can be claimed to
the respective companies. The companies usually do not delete the mistakes, but
comments can be added.

Lately, even credit card companies are advertising that they protect against
identity theft by electronically monitoring what people buy and sounding an
alarm if the behavior pattern changes abruptly. Newspaper ads like the one in
Figure (#2) show grotesque situations: a truck driver sitting in his underwear
and holding a can of soda in the hairdresser's salon under the dryer. The ad
text begins with "It seemed strange to us" and explains that the trucker's
credit card was suddenly charged $5000 for a beauty salon and the credit card
company stepped in. On television, there are commercials in which a grandmother
in a deck chair speaks with the shrill voice of a teenager, telling how she
just spent a lot of money on clothes.

@Z: You're fired! (The Apprentice)

<em>Michael</em>
Now there's one new reality show: "The Apprentice", in which the real
estate tycoon Donald Trump finds a CEO for one of his companies via television.

<pic images/mini1.ps One of the candidates: Mini skirt from the frog's perspective.>

First, the 14 young and dynamic candidates filtered from 215,000 applications
were divided into two teams: 7 women and 7 men each formed a group. As a team,
they had to tackle small business tasks such as renting an apartment, selling
lemonade on the street, running a restaurant or casino for a day, or organizing
a golf tournament. The losing team had to appear in the "Board Room" in front
of Trump with the previously determined project manager and two other
candidates, and then Trump "fired" someone for not performing.

<pic images/limo.ps The two men are "Apprentice" candidates and are selling lemonade on the street. The lady with the concrete hairstyle is Trump's briefcase carrier, overseeing the action.>

Interestingly, the women won one challenge after another, following the motto
"Sex Sells" -- at Planet Hollywood they visibly excited male customers to buy
expensive liquor, and a gold bar dealer nervously looked into the camera as
they performed daring exotic dances to lower the sale price. At a victory
celebration, Trump then intervened and made it clear to the ladies' team that
they didn't need to prostitute themselves like that.

<pic images/board4.ps The dreaded "Board Room", where the failures are fired.>

It is noticeable that Trump is an amazing manager with excellent personnel
management qualities. He leaves nothing to chance. The show is an efficient
advertising campaign for his empire, which is rumored to be in financial
difficulties. Unscrupulously, advertising is done for his casinos, real estate
companies and even his business buddies; some advertising agencies get a free
appearance at prime time.

However, it seems that there is a very authoritarian climate in the Trump
empire. Everyone talks to Trump as "Mr. Trump" as if he were the emperor of
America. Even his two "executive" briefcase carriers, who allegedly manage some
of his businesses, are competing to flatter their boss. This so-called
"brown-nosing" was news to me in America; my relationship with various bosses
has been more comradely. But maybe I'm spoiled by an internet company, and I
usually don't hang out in the upper floors. In any case, I wouldn't last two
days with the sycophants in the Trump empire. And I've been with AOL for almost
seven years!

<pic images/yf.ps The gesture of "You're fired!" when Donald Trump gives someone the boot in "The Apprentice".>

However, Trump suffers from a bad case of what we call "cow taste" in Germany.
Everything that is supposed to look luxurious is loaded with gold and plunder,
bending and breaking, and each of his offices looks like Circus Circus in Las
Vegas. And his hairstyle is already legendary bad. So bad that late-night show
host David Letterman already held a quiz in which candidates had to guess which
hairstyle belonged to a chimpanzee and which belonged to Donald Trump at
half-covered photos. Pretty tough!

Furthermore, he allegedly wants to patent the expression "You're fired!" in
America as part of the general patent hysteria. Read it quickly in the
newsletter before the lawyers of the Trump empire intervene!

@Z: Boing-Boom-Tschack!

<em>Michael</em>
Due to a recommendation from Mr. Huber, who was enthusiastic about a concert of
the band "Kraftwerk" in Bavaria, and claimed that no one still snaps the
tweeters as elegantly as they do, I bought a ticket for their concert in San
Francisco and was enchanted!

<pic images/k2.ps The four immobile power workers in minimalism.>

The four not-so-young Germans, who remained musically faithful but switched
consistently to laptops instead of giant computers, still play their electronic
compositions like robots. Hardly anyone moves behind their standing desk.
Otherwise the stage is empty. Gigantic video projections in the background. In
the penultimate stage setting, suddenly it is not the Kraftwerker themselves on
stage, but gracefully moving robots! Musically, most of it is pre-programmed,
but when the Kraftwerkers are on stage, they vary enough details live so that
each concert is a little different.

<HTMLONLY><pic images/kraftwerk.ps Kraftwerk concert in San Francisco></HTMLONLY>

The audience was an interesting mix of German residents of San Francisco,
top-league computer hackers (I recognized Brian Behlendorf) and black DJ types.

I'm touched to think that I still have her record "Trans Europa Express" from
1977 as a vinyl disc, which is sitting in a moving box in an attic near
Augsburg!

@Z: The Newsletter Top Product

<pic images/vrec.ps The Olympus VN-900 Voice-Recorder is a very good device.>

<em>Michael</em> Ha, here's another crazy idea! However, the best ideas come to
me in the most impossible situations and if I don't write them down
immediately, I forget them as quickly as they came. That's why I've been
accustomed for years to jot down any jolt of brain activity immediately. Of
course, I don't always have pen and paper with me and when I'm cycling through
the city or creativity strikes the train, it's hard to write it down. That's
why I've been carrying a small digital dictaphone with me for some time now.
Everywhere: on trips, in the car, on the bike, on the plane and even in the
gym.

I can quickly record short messages on the Olympus VN-900 voice recorder, "the
Digi", as I call it, then it digitally captures my words in amazing quality.
It stores them until I have time to transform them into projects and enter them
into my calendar. I can operate the Digi with one hand without looking and it
even stores the date and time of the recording. And it's only slightly bigger
than a disposable lighter, much smaller than even the smallest mobile phones
and only costs about 35 dollars. It stores up to 100 messages, up to 30
minutes, but no one has that many ideas. And the batteries last forever. Good
thing I recently recorded a note to promote the Digi as a top product in the
newsletter! And if I look at the illustration photo I just took, I wonder if I
should work as a hand model for the advertising industry. What do you say?

@Z: Hawaii - Big Island

<HTMLONLY><pic images/big1.ps Angelika sitting under a palm tree></HTMLONLY>

<em>Angelika</em> Munich residents go skiing in the mountains, Oldenburgers go
shopping in the Dutch city of Groningen, and Californians go to relax in
Hawaii. As you can see, we were back in Hawaii again. Since we had already
visited every inhabited Hawaiian island, we thought we'd start over with "Big
Island". Just to remind you: "Big Island" is officially called Hawaii. Since
Hawaii is also the collective term for the island group and the state, everyone
calls it "Big Island". The somewhat unimaginative name refers solely to the
size of the island.

<HTMLONLY><pic images/blume2.ps Red flower in the bush.></HTMLONLY>

Why do we keep coming back to Hawaii? It's simple: the weather is great, the
ocean is warm, the beaches are beautiful. You don't need a visa or annoying
vaccinations, there's no malaria, everyone speaks English, the landscape is
exotic without the addition of annoying, poisonous snakes or other dangerous
animals. The snake argument is especially high on Michael's list. Snakes are
not really his thing and I remember our trips to Australia, where he always
sent me ahead on hiking trails to check out the snake situation, because
Australia is known to have the most poisonous snakes in the world. But I
digress.

<HTMLONLY><pic images/palme.ps Palm tree on the beach></HTMLONLY>

Funnily enough, different small creatures loved us on this vacation. It started
when I stepped on a sea urchin in the ocean. I initially thought a sharp, long
dagger had rammed into my foot to split it (seriously - that's how it felt).
Bravely, I pulled out the spines, but I couldn't see anything in the choppy
ocean. So, I limped out of the water and examined my foot on the beach. I
discovered a slightly bleeding cut. A cool surfer who was strolling past our
beach spot inspected my wound and brought up the sea urchin theory. He kindly
explained the treatments practiced on the island: first, pee on the wound or
soak the foot in vinegar water to relieve the burning pain, then use tweezers
to pluck out the spines. Nurse Michael, also known as "Rabiato", took on the
task of removing the spines. The next day, everything was forgotten, except
that the people splashing around with me in the ocean probably wondered why the
woman in the red bikini was walking on eggshells on the soft sand. One step on
a sea urchin is enough.

<pic images/spinne.ps Murderspider on the rental car. Allegedly not poisonous.>

A few days later, a huge spider visited us, seeing the driver's door of our
rental car as a cozy spot. Michael immediately named it "Murder Spider". And
when I read to him from the travel guide that there is indeed a dangerous
species of spider on Hawaii, the "Black Widow", Michael
was beside himself. Otherwise, we only shared our accommodation with the
obligatory, insect-eating, completely harmless geckos, which are luminous green
on Big Island.

<pic images/gecko.ps A small gecko in the flower pot on our terrace.>

<em>Michael</em> It is completely normal for geckos to roam around the house.
The cute lizard-like reptiles occasionally make a quiet frog-like sound like
"E-cko!", climb up walls with suction cup feet, lounge around near lamps, and
elegantly snatch pesky mosquitoes and other pests. I always make sure there are
enough geckos in the house. Nothing is more calming than hearing a mosquito
buzz at night and thinking: The gecko will get you soon, bahahahaha!

<pic images/beach.ps Angelika is balancing on the beach covered in lava.>

<em>Angelika</em> Big Island, with its varied landscapes, almost feels like a
mini-continent. Where else can you find active volcanoes, white, black and
green beaches, meadows and fields, lush tropical vegetation on one side and
hardened black lava on the other? On Big Island, I finally understood what
volcanoes are all about and how new earth is created. Yes, I admit it,
geography was not one of my favorite subjects in school. That may also be
because my class teacher, Mr. Senst, tortured us with terms like end moraines
and the effects of the ice age in seventh grade, but I was more concerned
with my effect on the opposite sex.

I don't remember that Mr. Senst ever mentioned volcanoes. Probably people learn
that in elementary school. When we drove past a papaya field on Hawaii, I
expressed my amazement as to why everything grows so well on lava soil. Michael
then gave me a lecture that this is the most fertile soil of all and that you
learn this in school. He even dug the name of this special soil out of his
memory.  Hmm, I always thought he spent his school time playing football on the
street and not buried in school books. In addition to these geological
considerations, philosophical thoughts always come to mind on Big Island when,
for example, the delicate green plant bravely makes its way through the hard
black masses of rock.

<HTMLONLY><pic images/papaya.ps A plantation of papaya trees.></HTMLONLY>

This time we didn't go to the flowing lava (see <RBLINK>001101#1</RBLINK>),
since it wasn't currently making its way to the ocean. Instead, we went to the
"LavaTree State Monument". There, bizarre-looking lava
tree trunks reach up to the sky. They were formed in 1790, when lava flowed
through this rainforest. Parts of the lava solidified on the wet tree trunks
and even though the trees themselves burned, the shaped lava shells remained
standing. I wouldn't have been surprised if a dinosaur had come around the
corner in this park.

<pic images/lavatree.ps A tree stump made of lava in the Lava Tree Monument Park.>

On Big Island (and Hawaii in general) I'm always fascinated anew by how
American it is -- and yet not: There's the obligatory American fast food, the
same chain stores, and the same TV programming. The street signs, of course,
don't look any different from the mainland at first glance, but a second look
reveals them: Kealakekua, Laupahoehoe, Anaeho'omalu.

<pic images/sign.ps Typical Hawaiian Street Names>

Tourists find resorts and golf courses, but also remnants of ancient
Hawaiian culture if you venture off the beaten path. For example, we hiked to
the Mo'okini Heiau sacrificial site, which is considered one of the oldest
Hawaiian temple complexes. The open-air temple, bounded by stone piles, is
located on the windy northern tip of the island and we had to go around some
huge puddles to get to it. The tradition says that people were also sacrificed
to the gods here. I believed it immediately: because the temple is so far from
the shot, nobody sees or hears anything.

Returning to today's Hawaiian lifestyle: The locals don't get easily
flustered and don't constantly hustle and bustle. For example, we experienced
how a typical New York family father with wife and two children at the beach
rental spread wild chaos because he still needed this and that folding chair as
well as a beach umbrella. The rental guy didn't care at all. Stolidly and in
slow motion he handed him everything. The chaos simply bounced off him. Even
that at 11 o'clock in the morning usually all beach umbrellas were already
rented out, didn't set the American entrepreneurial spirit in motion in Hawaii
to buy more beach umbrellas in order to be able to rent out more. "Hang loose"
is the motto of the islanders.

@Z: Addendum to same-sex marriage
 
In our last newsletter, we reported in detail about the issuance of marriage
certificates to same-sex couples in San Francisco
(<RBLINK>20040301#1</RBLINK>). Over 4,000 couples were able to marry before the
California Supreme Court temporarily stopped this act of civil disobedience on
March 11th. As previously announced, supporters and opponents of same-sex
marriage are preparing for a lengthy legal battle in California. On the other
hand, in the state of Massachusetts, the dream of same-sex marriage has been a
reality since May 17th. Homosexual couples receive the marriage certificate
with all the rights and obligations granted to heterosexual couples in
Massachusetts. However, congress has stipulated that in 2006 the voters
will decide whether same-sex marriage will remain in Massachusetts. But until
then, the wedding bells will definitely continue to be ringing.

@Z: Current news about the war

For weeks, the newspapers have been full of discussions and debates about the
torture that American soldiers committed in Iraq. Smart minds are discussing
how it happened and what should be done about it. Politicians, psychologists,
philosophers, and the general public are all voicing their opinions. There is
also a wide range of reactions: deepest indignation, soothing, and blame. I was
not surprised by the behavior of the American soldiers, because in other wars,
such as the former Yugoslavia, there have always been completely inhumane
behaviors from all sides. The fact remains that a democratic state has already
lost when it sees war as a legitimate political means.

Greetings from San Francisco, the city with an absolute majority against Bush.
