@Z: The Speedo Trap

<pic images/l1.ps Long short pants>

<em>Michael</em> Americans find
the typical swimwear worn by German tourists hilarious.
I was not aware of this fact for a long time and often went
swimming in the typical German and tight swimsuits, called "speedos" here
in America. I received many strange looks.

What I didn't know was that heterosexual Americans never wear anything skimpier
than boxershorts. Anything else may be fashionable on hot days at Dolores Park
in San Francisco, where the toned men of the gay scene bask in the sun. But it
would never occur to the average American to wear a tight-fitting swimsuit.

<pic images/dolores.ps At Dolores Park, mainly good-looking men are sunbathing.>

Also, even the shorts for men are longer in the US than in Europe. For
heterosexual men, it's almost all the way to the knee, if not longer. I would
draw the line at a hand's breadth above the knee. In San Francisco's Castro
district, around our corner, you can also often see slightly more revealing
clothing pieces, like hotpants, but only for those who like it!

In predominantly American-populated tourist destinations such as Hawaii, where
few Germans wander, it is a hilarious sight to observe self-confidently
striding typically-German (tm) in speedos on the beach who have not yet gotten
the memo! Even Linux creator Linus Torvalds, who has been
living in America for a long time, seems to be unaware of this fact, as the
pictures from the
<LINK>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGvFzPO6jW4|Linus Dunk</LINK> prove.
Granted, it's not easy to figure this out coming from Germany. But once you have,
it's quite hilarious!

@Z: Fight against obesity: The Atkins Diet

<pic images/atkins2.ps Fast food chain "Subway" offers an "Atkins-friendly" menu with salads and sandwiches.>
 
<em>Angelika</em> Europeans have always scoffed at the fat Americans. That 2/3
of the American population struggles with being overweight and 1/3 are
medically considered obese is no secret here in the USA either.

Nowadays, there are increasingly fatter children because kids eat too much
fast food and hang out in front of the TV and computer for hours. That children
develop juvenile diabetes due to bad eating habits can almost be called a
trend. Desperate parents therefore initially tried to sue McDonald's, since the
fast food chain did not clearly warn of the health risks of its product range.
This typical American way of dragging everyone to court still seems absurd to
us.

Even the diet craze is not new. Every American book store has an impressive
selection of books that are meant to help reduce excessive pounds. Then there
are the various talk shows that present dramatic success stories: people who
suddenly fit into their old pants three times, smiling happily into the camera.
Lately, you can also find entertainment shows in which a whole group fights
their excessive weight together and is accompanied by television cameras for
months.

There is no shortage of theories as to why Americans are gaining more and more
weight. There is a preference for large portions and fast food. Unhealthy food
is cheaper than healthy food (which is true). No time to cook healthier meals,
lack of exercise, too much fat in the meals, too many carbohydrates. And on the
packaging of each product, there are indications of calories, carbohydrates,
etc. printed - but these always refer to a so-called "serving size", not to the
entire package. So if someone eats the whole bag of chips, they wonder why they
are consuming ten times the amount of calories!

The fear of high fat content in food led to a boom in reduced-fat products
here. In every American supermarket you can find low-fat chips, cookies and the
like. It happens to me from time to time that I grab the wrong - reduced-fat -
bag. A misery, because the stuff simply tastes artificial and usually ends up
in the trash can with us. My motto is: When eating chips, then the right ones.

<pic images/atkins4.ps Low-Carb Cookies: 120 Calories, 9 Net Carbs per "Serving Size".>

But I always get the real crisis when standing in front of the shelf with the
dairy products.  You almost need telepathic abilities to find the full-fat
yoghurt or the full-fat milk. There is usually only one kind of the "full-fat
variant". Everything else is low-fat or non-fat. Now I know that this trend has
now also infected Germany. I just pray fervently that my German favorite
potato chips will be spared.

For some time now, America has been in the second phase of its fight against
obesity. No longer is fat the focus of the debate, but rather the "evil"
carbohydrates. The blame for this lies with American doctor Robert Atkins, who
more than 30 years ago caused nutritionists around the world to scoff at
his low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Atkins assumes that the consumption of
carbohydrates stimulates insulin production, which can not only lead to
stronger feelings of hunger but also to fat storage. On the other hand, if one
abstains from bread, pasta, rice and highly sugary drinks, etc., the body will
in turn burn fat.

Critics of the Atkins diet don't necessarily dispute this, but they are
disturbed by the allowed consumption of foods with a high fat content due to
the increased risk of heart disease. However, the fact is that most people lose
weight with Atkins. Many nutritionists, however, attribute the weight loss to
the reduced calorie intake under the Atkins diet.

Nevertheless: Atkins has been on everyone's lips for the past 2-3 years. I know
some followers of the diet, which you can always tell because there is no bread
on their plate. The popularity of this low-carbohydrate diet was not affected
by the death of Robert Atkins in 2003, which was accompanied by malicious
rumors. It was rumored that Atkins was overweight at the time of his death and
had a few extra pounds.

In any case, the pragmatic American businessmen smell ringing cash registers
with the Atkins fans. Several restaurant and fast food chains have already
adapted to these customers. So there are Atkins-friendly menus at "Subway" and
"TGI Friday's" ("Thank God it's Friday). For example, the New York steak with
blue cheese crumbles is only 6 carbohydrates at TGI Friday's. From now on,
customers at Burger King can also happily bite into a hamburger without a bun,
the minced meat patty is held together by a lettuce leaf.

<pic images/atkins3.ps Even ice cream on a stick is available as a low-carb product with an Atkins label.>

Even manufacturers of various spirits are now advertising that their high-proof
distillates contain no carbohydrates! In addition, more and more products with
reduced carbohydrate content are quietly and secretly entering American
supermarkets. According to the magazine Consumer Reports, there are now 930
such products on the American market: beer, ice cream, cookies, cake -
everything the heart desires. They then have such nice names like "Atkins
Endulge" or "Carb Smart".

Even Coca-Cola is coming out with a new cola variety this summer that contains
fewer carbohydrates. Usually, sugar is replaced by sugar alcohols or
fermented carbohydrates, which allegedly stimulate insulin production in the
body less than regular sugar. The packaging of the "low-carb" (=low
carbohydrate) products then advertises how many carbohydrates are hidden in the
product, although the current American food law does not yet define what is
considered low.

Generally, few carbohydrates in a product does not necessarily mean few
calories. The idea that it is okay to indulge in low-carb cookies does not hold
up. What I find interesting about the whole carbohydrate story is that the
country is again following the motto "all or nothing". Americans tend to be a bit
extreme in this regard. We already saw this in the fight against smokers in
California (now you can't even smoke on the beach in Santa Monica). And once
they had set their sights on the enemy "carbohydrates", there was no stopping
them.

@Z: Postal Service in the USA.

<pic images/mailbox.ps (#1) Typical mailboxes. The red signal indicates that the rightmost freshly stamped mail contains something for the postman to take away.>

<em>Michael</em> Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays
these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds. This is the
official <LINK>http://www.usps.com/history/his8.htm|motto of the American
Post</LINK> (no joke!), also known as the United States Postal Service (USPS).
The motto is stolen from the ancient Greeks, 430 BC the Greek historian
Herodotus wrote this sentence about the riding messengers of Xerxes, the King
of Persia.

Mail carriers don't enjoy the best reputation in the US. In the TV series
"Seinfeld," the mailman "Newman" always calls in sick when it rains, hides bags
of undelivered mail in the basement, and claims that zip codes are meaningless.

But there are also positive sides: So a letter that does not weigh more than 2
ounces (32g) costs only 37 cents, no matter where in the USA, even to Hawaii or
Alaska. For heavier shipments, the distance also plays a role.

In Figure (#1) you can see typical American mailboxes. They are not locked,
anyone can open the flap. When the postman comes, he opens the flap and puts
the mail in.

In the cities there are also often mailboxes that look like their German
counterparts, but are simply holes in the wall, and the mail simply falls
inside the house after being dropped in.

<HTMLONLY>A mailbox directly into the house.</HTMLONLY>

In <suburbs> or <rural> areas, the mailman drives through the area in a
right-hand-drive car. Cars with the steering wheel on the right side are
usually only found in countries with left-hand traffic, but this special
construction has the advantage in the US that the mailman can pull up on the
right side and throw the mail into the mailbox without getting out. Sitting on
the right side in the front of the car, however, he can hardly see to the left
in the back, and therefore the mail car has several oversized mirrors so that
the driver can safely drive the monster from mailbox to mailbox.

<pic images/postauto.ps The motorized postman throws the mail from the car into the mailbox.>

With the booming eBay phenomenon, more and more people are sending their junk,
which others have bid on in auctions. The usually antiquated-looking USPS has
come up with something new: on the internet, on the website usps.com, you can
create a mailing label with a barcode, print it out on paper or self-adhesive
labels with your home printer, and pay with a credit card right away. You have
to specify the exact weight and dimensions of the package, and the USPS website
shows how much postage it costs. Up to one pound it's $4.50, up to two pounds
it's $8.50 for the farthest distances within America.

With the label available through the new service, which has a printed tracking
number, you can then track it on the internet to see where the package is and
if the lucky recipient has already received it. And this originally genius
service invented by the private delivery company UPS doesn't cost a cent more!

If you then drop off the package at the post office, you don't have to queue
up, but just slide it to the next clerk, because everything is already done.
Or, you just give it to the postman who is currently delivering the mail in the
house. By the way, this is common in America: The mailman not only delivers
mail, but also takes freshly stamped new mail. In big cities this is rather
unknown, because the postmen are totally stressed there, but in rural areas it
is quite normal to put the sent mail in the tube-shaped own mailbox and bend up
the red signal as shown in Figure (#1). Before the mailman then puts in the
delivered mail, he takes out the freshly stamped one that has been prepared
there and later hands it in at the post office.

For heavier packages, the "Ground" services of private delivery companies like
UPS and Fedex are cheaper than the US Postal Service. Instead of sending it by
plane, heavy cargo is sent "Ground", i.e. by truck across the continent, and
can be tracked with a tracking number to see how the heavy iron is carted
through the individual states. A real thrill! For example, I once sold a 20kg
computer printer on Ebay to a gentleman in New York City, who paid the 39
dollar Fedex postage without complaint, and after a week and 3000 miles by
truck, received the printer intact.

@Z: Credit Report

<pic images/crep.ps The independent magazine "Consumer Reports" reports on "Identity Theft".>

<em>Michael</em> In the USA, the financial activities of every citizen are
closely monitored by three private companies: Equifax, Trans Union and
Experion. I mentioned this briefly in <RBLINK>20010501#6</RBLINK>. When you
open a bank account, apply for a credit card, or take out a loan for a house --
bam! a notification goes to the three. On the other hand, when you apply for a
job with a company or show interest in renting a new apartment -- bam! the
company or landlord will ask the three about your financial situation.

Moreover, the three of them learn from every small mistake: If one forgets to
transfer the monthly payment to the credit card company just once, it will
immediately be prominently displayed in the "Credit Report". If one has 10
credit cards, two leased cars and has financed 3 houses over the last 10 years,
like the average American, this report will quickly become confusing.

Since Americans like to keep things simple, financial companies like "Fair
Isaac" generate a so-called "Credit Score", a number between 300 and 850 that
indicates a person's creditworthiness. The higher the score, the better: 300
indicates a notorious bankrupt, whom nobody would trust. However, from 720
onwards, banks swarm around the customer like moths to a light, this value
distinguishes carefully operating people whose transactions have been recorded
for some time and have never shown irregularities.

When someone wants to buy a house and applies for a loan, the bank employee
goes to the computer, retrieves the score and then offers the customer the
interest rate according to an internal table, similar to the following:

<HTMLONLY><table border="1"><tr><th>Credit Score</th> <th>Interest Rate</th></tr><tr><td>720-850</td> <td>5.73%</td></tr><tr><td>700-719</td> <td>5.83%</td></tr><tr><td>675-699</td> <td>6.39%</td></tr><tr><td>620-674</td> <td>7.30%</td></tr><tr><td>560-619</td> <td>8.66%</td></tr><tr><td>500-559</td> <td>9.10%</td></tr></table></HTMLONLY>

It pays off, therefore, to keep one's "Credit Report" in order and to know
one's "Score", which could translate into actual money. For Germans who have
recently moved to the USA, the Credit Report is simply empty, and it is not so
easy to apply for a credit card or to rent an apartment.

The "Credit Report" is kept under the Social Security Number (SSN) of a person.
Every American has one. It consists of 9 digits, in the format XXX-XX-XXXX. It
accompanies one throughout life, almost everyone knows it by heart. As an
immigrant, one is assigned an SSN when registering with the Social Security
Administration in the USA with a valid work visa (see
<RBLINK>970126#3</RBLINK>).

She should be kept secret, because it also serves for identification of a
person. For example, when I call my bank account, the automated voice asks me
for the last four numbers of my SSN before it reads out the account data. When
sending an application for a new credit card, the SSN must be on it.

<pic images/idt.ps (#2) A truck driver in a beauty salon? Something's not right! The Citi Bank is advertising a credit card with protection against identity theft.>

In terms of <b>data protection</b>, one gets the <b>bare horror</b>. Some
health insurance companies take the SSN as a membership number and print it on
the card so that every doctor's assistant can see it. Every time I write
something for an American publisher and get paid for it, I have to submit my
SSN so that it is correctly taxed. Recently, a secretary even wanted me to send
her the SSN by email - which I had to give a lengthy lecture about how the text
of any normal email is accessible to anyone who sits at a computer somewhere
between the sender and the receiver. Even the registration form for the Costco
shopping paradise asks for the SSN, it's unbearable to keep it in mind!

This total devaluation of the SSN has led to the need to think very carefully
about who to actually give one's SSN to. Even if it is asked for, one sometimes
has to really say "No!" In recent years, authorities have registered a drastic
increase in "Identity Theft" crimes. If someone knows someone else's SSN and
also knows their name and address, it is very easy to open accounts, apply for
credit cards and do all kinds of mischief. The victims often don't notice this
for years until one day the rude awakening comes when unexpectedly high bills
arrive and the reputation is ruined. It often takes years for the victims to
repair the damage.

Therefore, consumer organizations and the independent magazine "Consumer
Reports" (similar to Stiftung Warentest in Germany) recommend that one should
check their "Credit Report" at least once a year with the three credit bureaus.
This costs $12.95 per bureau (so a total of $38.85) and can be quickly done
over the internet with companies like
<LINK>http://www.myfico.com|MyFico</LINK>. There, one not only has to provide
their SSN and driver's license number, but also has to answer a series of
tricky questions to ensure that they are indeed who they claim to be.

There, you can then see your Credit Score and all accounts, credit cards, and
loans you have ever applied for per credit monitoring firm. Additionally, the
website shows any irregularities and gives tips on how to increase your Credit
Score.

For example, if one has never taken out a loan, one should simply apply for a
small one for fun, pay it back properly, and the score will increase. However,
if one asks for the credit report too often, this will reduce the score, so be
careful!

Since Dadie works for three companies independently, it is important to check
all three to make sure that no mistakes have been made that can be claimed to
the respective companies. The companies usually do not delete the mistakes, but
comments can be added.

Lately, even credit card companies are advertising that they protect against
identity theft by electronically monitoring what people buy and sounding an
alarm if the behavior pattern changes abruptly. Newspaper ads like the one in
Figure (#2) show grotesque situations: a truck driver sitting in his underwear
and holding a can of soda in the hairdresser's salon under the dryer. The ad
text begins with "It seemed strange to us" and explains that the trucker's
credit card was suddenly charged $5000 for a beauty salon and the credit card
company stepped in. On television there are commercials in which a grandmother
in a deck chair speaks with the shrill voice of a teenager, telling how she
just spent a lot of money on clothes.
