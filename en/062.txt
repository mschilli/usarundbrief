@Z: World Cup in America

<pic images/do2.ps Thousands are watching the game in Dolores Park.>

<em>Michael</em> 
The World Cup is indeed long over, but I still wanted to report on
how such an event unfolds in a country where soccer is a completely
exotic sport. The World Cup matches were broadcast almost exclusively
on the sports channel ESPN, which we unfortunately don't have due to
frugality. Fortunately, the Spanish channel also aired them, and this
even had the advantage of not having to listen to the uneducated
comments of the American soccer commentators. In
<RBLINK>20020723#1</RBLINK>
we have already reported that South Americans always shout "Goooool!"
when a goal is scored. Do you want to hear it live? This time we
present the goal commentary as an MP3, listen in:
<LINK>https://usarundbrief.com/62/images/golschweini.mp3|TV sound during the 1-0 in the Germany vs. Portugal match</LINK>.

At Yahoo, the games were shown on large flat-screen TVs in our coffee
bar on the ground floor. Most of them started at 9:00 in the morning
or at 11:00 AM, and there were always smaller and sometimes larger
groups of employees who took two hours off to watch a match. Even
some Americans joined in! By the way, during the Argentina game, most
people were cheering for Germany.

Large screens like those in Germany did not exist in the USA, so a
German immigrant in San Francisco came up with a plan: He wanted to
rent a large TV screen and show the game in Dolores Park in San
Francisco. He probably had the thought in the back of his mind that
maybe the German team would be playing in the final, but unfortunately, that
didn't happen.

<pic images/do4.ps This man was to be proven right.>

<pic images/dodog.ps The dog was right, too.>

But no sooner said than done, German man Jens-Peter Jungclaussen
obtained the necessary permits for the event from the city of San
Francisco, rented the required number of portable toilets, and even
had to hire police officers responsible for security.

<pic images/do5.ps The mounted television screen>

All in all, the fun cost about $17,000, which he hoped to recoup
through sausage sales and voluntary donations. He probably expected a
few hundred spectators, but what happened due to word of mouth, an
email avalanche on the internet, and finally an announcement in a
major newspaper was incredible: About 7,000 people showed up! San
Francisco is not lacking in Italians, and there is also a
considerable number of French people. And even a German flag was
spotted! I have never seen so many people in the relatively small
Dolores Park; people were really sitting shoulder to shoulder on the
grass.

<pic images/dofrance.ps Not everyone can win.>

<pic images/dodon.ps Voluntary donations>

The German-American Chamber of Commerce in San Francisco did not hold
back and contributed to the costs for the TV screen, and I think that
the donations and sausage sales easily covered total expenses.

<pic images/dogrill.ps The men at the grill had their hands full.>

In America, you are not allowed to drink beer in public, and the
permit for the event in Dolores Park was apparently granted only on
the condition that no alcohol would be consumed. The announcer
pointed this out over the loudspeaker, and the police officers on
duty also admonished beer drinkers, but with a wink. Overall, it was
still an exhilarating event!

@Z: Spare the Air

<pic images/spare.ps Spare the Air Day -- Drive and Save>

<em>Angelika</em> 
San Francisco is notorious for its natural air conditioning, namely
the cool air and fog. This makes many tourists, dressed only in
T-shirts and shorts, shiver during the summer months. The fog forms
because the hot air from inland flows towards the ocean, which is
quite cold, and -- voila -- everything is enveloped as if in cotton.
The meteorologists amongst you may forgive me for this simplified
explanation.

Since the temperature difference is particularly large in the summer
months, there is also the most fog between June and August. Now, you
shouldn't think that we are constantly sitting in a gray soup. During
the day, the fog clears, the city heats up to over 75F, and
only later in the late afternoon does the fog slowly creep back into the
city. Neighborhoods close to the ocean are most affected; those
who live in the "Richmond" or "Sunset" pay less rent but sit in the soup
more often. Our neighborhood "Noe Valley" and the nearby "Mission"
are considered the sunniest. However, the fog phenomenon provides the
city of San Francisco with a pleasant breeze, and thus generally good
air. Smog, we like to joke, we generously leave to Los Angeles.

However, there are occasionally hot days without wind that cause
ozone levels to skyrocket. And when the thermometer rises in San
Francisco, people in the rest of the Bay Area groan and moan even
more, because in cities like Mountain View or San Jose, which are
further inland, the thermometer rises above 95F, and the heat
becomes unbearable. To improve air quality on such days, the "Bay
Area Air Quality Management District" introduced the so-called
"Spare-the-Air" days in 1991.

If the ozone levels are expected to exceed a certain value, the day
is declared a "Spare the Air Day" in advance. To encourage people to
leave their air-polluting cars, all public transportation in San
Francisco and the surrounding area ("Bay Area") is free on those days. Even the
train that runs from San Francisco through Silicon Valley to San Jose
is free all day. Previously, this only applied to the morning
commute, but this year it has been extended to the entire day.
Surprising, isn't it? The whole initiative actually seems to be
working, as 10% more people use public transportation on such days.
Additionally, there is hope that some people will develop a
preference for it and continue using the subway, streetcars, trains, and
buses.

<pic images/spare2.ps Ticket validators are taped over on 'Spare the Air Day'.>

Unfortunately, there were three hot days in June that were declared
"Spare-the-Air" days, which exhausted the budget for this season,
running from June to mid-October for the "Spare-the-Air" program.
Hmm! However, the responsible authorities scraped together an
additional 5.3 million, partly from the "Vehicle Registration" fund
(similar to the German vehicle tax). This amount will probably be
enough for three more days this year. The various transportation
companies receive compensation from this source for the money they
lose.

@Z: Immigration Debate

<pic images/immi2.ps Immigrant children demonstrate on May 1st.>

<em>Angelika</em> 
The myth that anyone who wants to live and work in America is
immediately handed a green card upon arrival is indestructible. But that's false,
America has not kept its doors wide open for everyone for a long
time. If you want a work permit, you not only have to navigate the
thicket of bureaucracy but also win the race against the quota, as
typically only a certain number of work visas or green cards are
issued in various categories each year.

These hurdles have led to many people becoming tired of waiting and
risking being in the country illegally. It is estimated that there
are now 11 to 12 million illegal immigrants living in the USA, with
almost 80 percent of them coming from Mexico or other Latin American
countries. This problem is not exactly new. Back in the late 1980s,
then-President Ronald Reagan tried to curb the influx of illegal
immigrants through legislation: any employer who knowingly hired
someone without a work permit would be committing a crime. However,
no reliable system was implemented to verify this. At the same time,
Reagan granted amnesty to illegal immigrants who had already been in
the country for several years.

Bush Jr. promised during his first election campaign to solve the
problem of illegal immigrants. However, other issues like September
11th and the Iraq War caused the topic to disappear from the spotlight.
But now it has resurfaced for quite some time. Hardly a day goes by
without the press addressing the issue of immigration. Since a large
portion of Americans can trace their own immigration history (even if
it often dates back generations), the topic is emotionally charged
here like no other.

It began in December 2005 when the American House of Representatives
(known as "Congress") passed a draconian bill that not only proposed
to seal the border with Mexico using a high-tech fence stretching
over 700 miles but also aimed to elevate illegal residence in the USA
to a criminal offense ("felony").

Until now, this has been a civil matter that violates existing
immigration law. There was an uproar mainly because the draft law
criminalizes helpers (such as family members, priests, social
workers) who assist illegal immigrants, which so enraged the Catholic
Cardinal of Los Angeles that he called on his priests to engage in
civil disobedience.

<pic images/immi1.ps Angelika's kindergarten supported the boycott on May 1st.>

Overall, none of the politicians really expected the protest from the
Latinos (as Latin Americans are called), because everyone quietly
assumed that illegal immigrants would not dare to take to the
streets. However, in the spring of this year, there were large
demonstrations in many American cities. In Los Angeles, half a
million people protested for more liberal immigration laws. The
illegal immigrants find broad support primarily among their
compatriots, who often now possess an American passport but arrived
in the USA in similarly adventurous ways. Since Latinos are the
fastest-growing population group in many states (including
California), politicians must be concerned about the votes of the
immigrants legally living in the country.

On May 1st, there was another protest action to demonstrate that
without illegal immigrants, many economic sectors would collapse and
that immigrants in general contribute to the economic well-being of
Americans. Immigrants (both legal and illegal) were called
upon not to go to work. In San Francisco, many businesses in the
Mission district, which has a high percentage of Latin Americans,
were closed as a result. The action was also supported at the
Tenderloin Childcare Center, where I work, because most of our
children come from foreign countries.

Since a bill in the USA goes through several instances, the
Senate transformed the draft described above into a more moderate
version in May. The Senate's bill also mentions better securing the
border with Mexico, but at the same time allows illegal immigrants
who have been in the country for longer to obtain legal
status after paying a fine and back taxes. A guest worker program is
also planned, which is particularly important to President Bush.
Furthermore, among other things, the number of H-1B visas issued
annually is to be increased (<RBLINK>20000526#9</RBLINK>).

<pic images/immi3.ps A Mexican store was closed on May 1st due to the immigrant demonstration.>

Now the whole thing goes back to Congress, and both bills need to be
reconciled with each other. And that's where opinions differ.
Currently, nothing is moving forward at all. To make matters worse,
Congress will be re-elected here in November, and everyone wants to
exploit the immigration debate for their political purposes.

@Z: Onlinetvrecorder

<pic images/zwei.ps (#1) The German Friday TV crime show is now also airing in San Francisco.>

<em>Michael</em> 
Through a service introduced in the second-to-last newsletter, named
<LINK>http://onlinetvrecorder.com|onlinetvrecorder.com</LINK>,
we can now also receive German television in San Francisco. So I
watch the Tagesschau almost every day now, and Angelika watches her
beloved Tatort.

If you plug the laptop into the TV, the picture appears on the screen
in top quality, and as you can see in illustration (#1), we have
nicely set up our little dinner tables while watching the Friday TV crime
show. Ah, that's a real treat again!

We usually only know hours of commercial-free television from our pay
channel HBO. However, with the shows streamed over the internet, we
also watch the German commercials, which often seem completely absurd
to someone who has spent almost 10 years in the USA.

What also stands out is the courage of broadcasters like 3Sat to air
programs that really only interest niche audiences. How many people
can actually engage with a program about Sigmund Freud? 0.1%? It's
amazing that this somehow pays off. You can really see what's missing
in the American television world, where every 'public' broadcaster
has to operate profitably without license fees and therefore has to
focus on mainstream tastes.

The service offered by onlinetvrecorder is apparently completely
legal, as the receivers that capture the German TV programs are
located close to the German border in Holland, and the internet
servers that offer the files for download are in the relatively
lawless zone of Antigua. Let's see how long it takes for the TV
giants in Germany to find a way to shut down the service. Until then,
we'll be watching recklessly! I've even built a kind of TiVo for
onlinetvrecorder.com, using Perl, so I can enjoy watching the shows
from my computer.

@Z: Nextbus.com

<pic images/muni.ps Runs according to a fantasy schedule: The J Muni train>

<em>Michael</em> 
In San Francisco, the streetcars are known to run according to a
fantasy schedule. The train doesn't arrive at a specific time;
instead, the schedule literally states "approximately every X
minutes," with X varying between 10 to 30 depending on the time of
day.

It is, of course, annoying to walk down three flights of stairs to
the stop and then wait there for 29 minutes because the tram just
left right in front of you.

As is often the case, Americans use advanced technology here to
make the chaos manageable. The streetcars have recently been equipped with a
transponder, and along the route, there are receivers that
record whenever a street car passes by.

The live measured data is sent to the
<LINK>http://nextbus.com|Website nextbus.com</LINK>
which calculates in how many minutes
the next train is expected to arrive at a defined stop. This can then be
queried for free and in real-time over the internet.

<pic images/nextbus.ps The website nextbus.com shows when the next Muni train will arrive at our stop.>

The system works perfectly. If I want to take the J streetcar to
downtown, I simply check on my computer shortly beforehand, which is
running 24 hours a day anyway. If the web browser then shows that the next
car will arrive at the intersection of 24th and Church "In 2
Minutes," a frenzy breaks out, I dash down the stairs and rush onto
the street. However, if it shows "In 15 Minutes," I fool around for
another 10 minutes before starting a leisurely descent. One of my
colleagues even has a cell phone with which he retrieves the data!

@Z: Screw Terminals Instead of Terminal Blocks

<pic images/klemme.ps The screw nut as a Substitute for Terminal Blocks>

<em>Michael</em> 
When installing a ceiling light in Germany, a so-called
Lüsterklemme" is often used. This is a plastic piece with small
screws and holes, into which you insert the stripped wire strands
from the back and front and then secure them with a screwdriver.

In the USA, there don't seem to be any terminal blocks, at least not
in the hardware stores I frequent. As I discovered by unscrewing old
ceiling lamps, small caps with an internal metal thread are commonly
used here instead, called screw nuts.

To connect the two strands of two 110-volt lines, you twist the
copper wires together and then place a cap on top, so that the metal
wires catch in the inner metal thread of the cap. Then you screw the
cap down clockwise, so that it grips the cable ends until no bare
wire is visible.

The paint job is done! Such practices are known as "botched work" in
Germany, but here it goes through perfectly. The method is cheap,
insulates, and you don't need a screwdriver. And luckily, it's only
110 volts here and not 220, otherwise, it could be quite frightening!

The cap is called in technical jargon, by the way.
<LINK> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist-on_wire_connector</LINK>
The company Ideal Industries introduced the groundbreaking world novelty in
1920 as the "Wire Nut" and registered the name as a trademark. And just like
people in Germany say "Tesa" instead of "Scotch Tape," the term "Wire Nut" has
become commonly used in American vernacular for the caps, even though nowadays
they are, of course, only produced cheaply in China.

@Z: Onomatopoeic Expressions

<pic images/dog.ps "Arf, arf!" says the dog.>

<em>Michael</em> 
Every language translates animal sounds slightly differently.
Sometimes, something similar comes out, like with the cow, which goes
"Muh" in German and the similar-sounding "moo" in English. But did
you know that the sound for a horse neighing is "neigh" (pronounced
"neehii")? By the way, in America, you don't urge a horse on with
"Hüh" and stop it with "Brr," as you do in Germany. Instead, you
start it with a double tongue click in the side/back of the mouth,
similar to how you might attract a horse or cow in Germany when
holding a carrot. A horse is stopped with "Whoa!" The latter is also
the warning sound you make when you would say "Achtung!" in German,
like when a piano is about to fall on someone's head.

In written English, the sound is called "tut-tut.
<LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tut-tut|Tut-tut</LINK>
It is spoken like typing with the tongue.

A dog goes "arf arf" or "bow wow" depending on its size. A trumpeting
elephant goes "baraag," a frog goes "ribbit," a goat goes "baa," and
a squealing pig goes "wee wee." On the internet, there are sites that list
<LINK>http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/Personal/dabbott/animal.html|Animal sounds in different languages</LINK>
There are quite a few surprises for non-native speakers!

@Z: San Francisco Views: Castro

<pic images/c10.ps The old street car goes to the Castro.>

<em>Michael</em> 
We have often reported on our neighboring district, the Castro.
Hardly any other district is as typical of San Francisco, and few are
as tidy and picturesque. The area, formerly known as "Eureka Valley,"
became the center of the gay movement in the early 1970s. Harvey
Milk, a political activist and later the first openly gay city
supervisor of San Francisco, opened a camera shop in the Castro at
that time. He was later shot by a homophobe, and the "Harvey Milk
Photo Center" still commemorates him today, where Angelika often
develops her pictures in the darkroom.

When someone at a party mentions that they live in the Castro, you
automatically think to yourself, "Aha! Gay." According to statistics,
41% of people in the Castro identify as gay, while it's only 11%
across the entire city. But believe me, being gay or lesbian is
completely normal in San Francisco. Sure, tourists are always
shocked, and even people from Silicon Valley giggle awkwardly when
they come to San Francisco and stumble around the Castro with bright
red faces. But let's be honest, in the end, the topic is irrelevant.
If you live in San Francisco long enough, you eventually ignore the
difference.

<pic images/c2.ps Newly rich, but with style>

<pic images/c3.ps Sometimes conservative ...>

Interestingly, the Castro is a relatively affluent area where people
with almost conservative inclinations live. No one drives just any
car; it's almost always the latest Mercedes, BMW, Porsche, or Audi.
No one lives in just any house; everything is appealing and lovingly
arranged and furnished. The shops offer exquisite wines and stylish
clothes, and even the household goods store "Cliff's Variety" only
carries items for people with taste who value details. Angelika
recently spent twenty dollars there on a simple egg timer! It's
crazy!

<pic images/c6.ps Colorful houses on Castro Street.>

<pic images/c7.ps The housewares and hardware store "Cliff's Variety" on Castro Street>

The rainbow flags are ubiquitous in the Castro, and noticeably many
men have short hair. There is a rich selection of excellent
restaurants, and people love to stroll through the streets, chatting
as if everyone knows everyone. The "Castro Theatre" is one of the
oldest cinemas in the city, and it features an excellent selection of
alternative, intellectually inclined films. Once a year, the
so-called "German Festival" takes place there, showcasing new German
films with English subtitles.

<pic images/c8.ps Rainbow flag and houses on Castro Street.>

<pic images/c9.ps Breakfast in the sun.>

However, the Castro is brutally hilly. Anyone who wants to ride a
bike through it should be prepared for quite a challenge, as it has
some of the steepest hills in San Francisco, with gradients of 30%
and upwards. We residents of Noe Valley often wander around the
friendly Castro, as there is a lot to see and you can never have
enough top-notch restaurants.

@Z: Off To the Redwoods

<pic images/rwtree2.ps A mighty redwood tree in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park>

<em>Angelika</em> 
And here's a quiz question: Which is the American holiday (apart from
December 25th and New Year's) that is always celebrated on the same
date? Correct, Independence Day on July 4th, which is why it's
commonly referred to as "4th of July." Other American holidays are
based on the weekday in a specific month, such as "Labor Day" on the
first Monday in September or "Thanksgiving" on the fourth Thursday in
November.

The 4th of July 1776 is considered, so to speak, the birth of the
United States, as the Declaration of Independence freed the nation
from the yoke of the English. Nowadays, Independence Day is mainly
characterized by somewhat patriotic parades, fireworks, and the
obligatory barbecues with friends and family. In San Francisco, the
fireworks often disappear into the fog. During the day, the weather
is fantastic, but just before the fireworks, the notorious summer fog
lives up to its name. This year, for a change, it was actually clear.
Due to the limited number of vacation days here, we use every holiday to
get away, and Yahoo! had also declared July 3rd a holiday. So we sped
up north in our beloved car "Perlman" to Humboldt County, home of the
Redwood National Park and various state parks under the patronage of
the State of California.

The so-called "Coast Redwoods" are truly a special kind of tree.
These "coastal redwood sequoias" can live up to 2000 years and, in
some cases, reach over 300 feet into the sky. About 180 feet is
the average height. There's nothing better than lacing up your hiking
boots and wandering through the redwood forest. How small and
insignificant one suddenly feels. We did this in the "Prairie Creek
Redwoods State Park."

<pic images/rwriv2.ps Perlman makes his way through a small stream to a remote hiking trail.>

To reach the parking lot of the hiking trail, we not only had to
drive a few miles on an unpaved road, but also cross two small
streams. Thankfully, the Perlman managed it with ease, even though it
sits quite low compared to American cars. And although the
campground, which was right on the beach, was bustling, we hardly
encountered anyone on the seven-mile loop trail.

During our hike, we repeatedly came across plaques that named small
sections of the forest after families. However, these are not
gravesites; the plaques simply bear the names of generous donors
whose funds were used to purchase Redwood land to protect the trees
from commercial exploitation. The groves named after the donors do
not belong to them; the plaques are merely a recognition of their
willingness to donate. This "Save-the-Redwoods-League-Program" was
established back in 1921 to preserve the Redwoods for future
generations. Even today, Redwoods are considered one of the most
sought-after types of timber.

@Z: Top product: The "Weber Q" Grill

<pic images/grill.ps A master of his craft: Michael is grilling two New York steaks on the "Weber Q".>

<em>Michael</em> 
The terms "home" and "grilling" are inseparably linked in America. A
home is not complete until there is a so-called barbecue (BBQ) in the
garden. The head of the family stands at it and prepares hamburgers
or steaks for the whole family. Important: Grilling is a man's job.

Grills are sacred devices. Everyone has "the best one," and grill owners
enjoy discussing how many <LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btu|BTUs</LINK>
theirs pumps out or how to best prepare a
particular cut of meat. Since we don't have a yard but only a small
balcony, it was important not to buy a 32-hamburger monster. The
"Weber Q" (pronounced "Webber Kju") is just right: serving up to six
guests is no problem, and the unit is so handy that it takes up
hardly any space. And you can really tell that it embodies the
extensive experience of the renowned
<LINK>http://www.weber.com|Grill company Weber</LINK>.
The heat is distributed evenly, so nothing burns and nothing remains
raw. It runs on small propane gas cartridges, which last for about 5
grilling sessions and cost $2. You can also buy an adapter for really
large propane gas tanks, but Angelika is always afraid that I'll blow
up our balcony.

I still remember exactly how the "Weber Q" came into the house. I had
ordered it online from Amazon and was still working at AOL at the
time. While I was sitting in the office, I suddenly received a call
from the mailroom saying that the grill had arrived. Great, I said,
when can you bring it to my cubicle? Well, stammered the AOL mailman,
it's not that simple; it was clear that this was a personal item, and
therefore I had to pick it up myself at the mailroom on the other
side of Sunnyvale. I was shocked! Up until then, I had ordered at
least a hundred things online, and the items had always been
delivered to my cubicle by the mailman working at AOL.

I didn't make a big fuss and just went to the given address in God's
name: "Caribbean Drive, Sunnyvale." Just before the corporate mail center, I
saw that there was a company called Yahoo! located there, right
before Caribbean Drive. A few weeks later, I applied there. The rest,
as they say, is history.

@Z: Crazy Videos

<pic images/tunak.ps The crazy video 'Tunak Tunak' on youtube.com>

<em>Michael</em> 
As loyal newsletter readers, you surely know the video website
youtube.com, as we've mentioned it a few times before. A revolution
is currently taking place there, with more and more people creating
their own TV shows. A young lady named 'Brookers' has apparently
influenced an entire generation of young people with her self-made
clips:
<LINK>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToZQ4qbKJGs|Video with the Brookers story</LINK>.
Of course, it's on YouTube, and now the lady is supposedly going to
get her own TV show.

More and more often, emails with funny links to YouTube videos are
being sent around nowadays, for example, recently the apparently
<LINK>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhI9UmD1lo4|Indian video "Tunak Tunak"</LINK>.
which immediately triggered a response in form of a 
<LINK>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAxKXqzOaWg|cover version by
Romanian teenagers</LINK>

And finally, here's the best of my email haul of the last few weeks: The
<LINK>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjrEQaG5jPM|video of an Indian traffic intersection</LINK>,
