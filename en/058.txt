Many complain that Christmas has become all about commerce, with no
room for reflection, silence, and introspection. To give you
something thought-provoking to read over the holidays, here is our
Christmas newsletter featuring a controversial topic that describes
an American phenomenon strongly influenced by the country's
conservative Christians. Curious? Let's dive in:

Poor Mr. Darwin would turn in his grave, as a fierce debate over the
topic of evolution has once again erupted in the USA, currently being
fought on the backs of American students. It's no wonder, as
according to a Gallup poll from November 2004, 45% of the American
population believes that God created humans in their present form
about 10,000 years ago. This literal interpretation of the creation
story is also known as creationism. This means that almost half of
Americans are more papal than the late Pope John Paul II, who passed
away this year. He stated that the theory of evolution is not only
compatible with the Christian faith but also represents more than
just a hypothesis. As you surely remember from biology class,
Darwin's theory of evolution asserts that living beings (including
humans) evolved from lower to higher forms through the process of
mutation and selection over millions of years.

In America, some religious zealots have always tried to push the
theory of evolution into the background in biology class. However,
in 1987, the justices of the Supreme Court put their foot down once
and for all. They ruled that creationism is a form of religion.
Religion, however, cannot be taught in public schools in the USA, as
the Constitution mandates a strict separation of church and state.
Therefore, creationism has no place in biology classes.

This highest judicial decision does not prevent various school boards
from conveying their negative stance towards the theory of evolution
to students through the back door. School boards in the USA do have
influence on the curriculum at the local level, even though public
schools are generally required to follow state guidelines
(<RBLINK>20030801#7</RBLINK>).
In Cobb County, in the state of Georgia, the school board decided to
place stickers on biology textbooks as a form of warning, with the
following text: "This textbook contains material on evolution.
Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living
things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied
carefully and critically considered." However, the sticker had to be
removed because Judge Clarence Cooper ruled in January of this year
that the text endorses the creationist viewpoint and is strongly
religious in nature. Twenty states are now considering changes to how
the theory of evolution is being taught. It becomes particularly
contentious when state-level curriculum guidelines oppose Darwin.
There is still much to be addressed by the individual courts.

Currently, all eyes are on Dover, Pennsylvania. At the end of 2004,
the school board there decided that a passage should be read to
students before the evolution unit. This passage states that state
guidelines require teaching Darwin's theory of evolution, but that it
is a theory and not a fact, and that "Intelligent Design" is an
alternative to Darwin's views. The statement kindly pointed out that,
therefore, the book
<LINK>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0914513400|Of Pandas and People</LINK>,
a standard work of the Intelligent Design movement, is available
for review. Behind "Intelligent Design" (ID) lies a sort of moderate
creationism. ID proponents claim that life is too complex and cannot
be explained solely by evolution. Only the existence of an
intelligent designer could account for the complexity. Who this
mysterious designer is remains open. The term "God" is deliberately
not mentioned. "Intelligent Design" does not interpret the creation
story literally but agrees that the Earth is billions of years old
and that life developed gradually. "Intelligent Design" presents
itself as quite scientific and even has its own institute, the
"Discovery Institute" in Seattle.

The scientific community is still waiting in vain for experiments to
test the hypothesis, so "Intelligent Design" remains what it is,
namely a bold claim. In contrast, Darwin's theory offers objective
evidence. Most scientists also refuse to discuss the concept of
"Intelligent Design" at all, to prevent unscientific claims from
gaining acceptance. For them, the theory of evolution is
scientifically undisputed. There is also concern that the USA will
lose its leading position in the natural sciences if students have to
grapple with dubious ideas like "Intelligent Design" in schools, and
many biology teachers, fearing conservative, religious parents, avoid
teaching evolution altogether. However, there are some scientists who
favor "Intelligent Design." Michael Behe, a professor of biochemistry
at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, whose book "Darwin's Black Box"
made him well-known, is one of the few. Behe is also associated with
the institute in Seattle. He often cites the complexity of the blood
clotting process as evidence for an intelligent designer.

Incidentally, Behe testified in the Dover school trial, where parents
sued against the introduction of "Intelligent Design" in their
children's biology classes. In January 2006, the presiding judge will
decide whether reading the aforementioned statement violates the
separation of church and state in public schools. The biology
teachers at Dover High School had already shown backbone by refusing
to read the statement. The superintendent then read it. There are now
no pro-"Intelligent Design" members left on the Dover School Board. The
citizens of Dover decided at the ballot box and voted them all out in
November 2005. Sometimes the democratic process works excellently in
this country.

The ultra-conservative televangelist Pat Robertson warned the
residents of Dover after this election outcome that they should not
turn to God in the next disaster, as they had just banished Him from
their town. Ah! Only in America!

President Bush, unsurprisingly, believes it is right to teach both
evolution and "Intelligent Design" in biology classes. In general, I
don't understand what the creationism or Intelligent Design debate is
doing in biology class. If anywhere, it belongs in philosophy
class. But no one asks me.

Well then, Merry Christmas from your two newsletter reporters, who
don't mind at all being descended from apes: Angelika and Michael.
