@Z: The recall of San Francisco's District Attorney

<em>Michael</em> I usually don't care about politics, except maybe when there's
something to laugh about. However, the fun of observing San Franciso politics has evaporated
completely in recent years, having to watch helpless feel-good politicians turning
the city into a lawless hellscape. When you can't buy a
bicycle anymore because it will be stolen immediately, or you can't park a car on
the street anymore because unchallenged thieves cut off the catalytic
converter in broad daylight, the fun stops eventually (USARundbrief reported).

Many others were in the same situation as us when we had to watch the San
Francisco District Attorney, Chesa Boudin, who was elected by the people for
four years, refuse to prosecute criminals arrested by the police. This kept
happening even for repeat offenders, the man obviously following a very absurd
and radical political ideology.  But eventually even the most tolerant citizens
of San Francisco were so fed up, that they demanded the dismissal of the
inactive prosecutor through a petition, only two years into his four-year term.
This "recall" procedure exists in the state of California for all kinds of
political offices, and even some of our governors have had to face a vote of no
confidence forced by the people. The signatures of angry citizens were
certified in November, and the actual recall vote was held on June 7, 2022.

<pic images/prop-h-no-flyer.ps (#3) Opponents of the recall claim that nefarious Republicans are behind it.>

When such referendums pile up, as is unfortunately the case in California, many
citizens simply don't bother to vote out of fatigue. Boudin was elected in 2019
with only a few votes ahead with a voter turnout of only 41%. However, in the
June 2022 recall, large parts of the city's population were so angry about the
prosecutor's missteps that 46% of them managed to cast their votes. 90% of them
voted by mail, 10% dragged themselves to one of the many polling stations
scattered across the city.

<pic images/sf-party-affiliation.ps (#5) Alas, in San Francisco, there are only 5 percent Republicans.>

As is now common across politics, unfortunately no party today runs fact-based
election campaigns or can even accept a democratically targeted election result
when they're not the winner. Every week I found new leaflets in our mailbox,
mainly from Boudin's fanatical followers, in which it was dramatically
explained to me that anyone who voted for the recall must be a Republican! The
whole recall process was allegedly financed by billionaires, some of whom were
even connected to Republicans in Congress, the flyers said! Interestingly, San
Francisco is one of the most left-leaning cities in the USA, with about 5%
Republicans and 63% Democrats, so "Republican" is an insult that hardly anyone
will tolerate.

Furthermore, it must be mentioned that practically every election campaign here
in the USA is sponsored by wealthy citizens, who finance television and
internet ads and donate money for spectacular stage appearances with lots of
balloons. Even Boudin's anti-recall campaign was funded by wealthy citizens who
supported his politics. But on election day, of course, it was the citizens who
went to the polls, each with only one vote, regardless of whether they were
rich or poor.

<pic images/election-map.ps (#6) Results of the Boudin Recall in San Francisco: https://electionmapsf.com>

With excitement, we followed the vote count after the polling boths had closed
in the evening hours of the day the votes were cast, and it quickly became
clear that Boudin had been ousted from office with a bang. A glance at the
<LINK>https://electionmapsf.com|election map</LINK> (Figure (#6)) made it clear
that purple-colored wealthy old hippie neighborhoods (Bernal Heights,
Haight-Ashbury, Noe Valley) and the Latin American Mission District wanted to
keep the district attorney. The residents of the green-colored neighborhoods,
who wanted to fire him, were composed of wealthy snobs (Pacific Heights,
Marina, Seacliff) and Asian working class (Sunset, Richmond, Excelsior), which
gave the edge due to the higher population count.

In his resignation speech, Boudin blamed wealthy Republicans who had funded the
recall with three times as much money as his own supporters. That he was simply
a bad fit for the job of District Attorney never occurred to him. You see,
when you lose an election nowadays, you don't look for the blame within yourself.
After all, you own the truth and everyone else is a fraud or simply crazy.
It's quite remarkable that democratic principles are no longer in demand with
the "Me! Me! Me!" generation, no matter if left or right.

The recall received surprisingly wide press coverage, and even though it was
only a city election, national news outlets such as CNN and the major daily
newspaper New York Times reported extensively on it. They all wanted to
recognize a political trend in the result. The magazine "The Atlantic" even
published a ten-page article titled
<LINK>https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/how-san-francisco-became-failed-city/661199/|"How San Francisco Became a Failed City"</LINK>, written by an author who grew up
in San Francisco, documenting the decline of the city she once loved. Worth
reading!

@Z: Sunken WWII Cannon Platform on the Beach

<pic images/funston-ring.ps (#1) On beach walks, one often comes across relics from the Second World War here.>

<em>Michael</em> One of our favorite hiking trails runs along the Pacific beach
below the former artillery position of Fort Funston. There, military
fortifications made of concrete from World War II protrude from the sand. The
whole thing gives the area an apocalyptic look, and always reminds me of the
first movie in the "Planet of the Apes" series, in which Charlton Heston is one
of the few survivors of an atomic war and stumbles upon such a relic protruding
from the sand. He realizes that the relic is the Statue of Liberty, and that
humanity has actually managed to blow up the planet, and he screams his famous
line: <LINK>https://youtu.be/XvuM3DjvYf0|"You maniacs! You blew it up! Damn you!"</LINK>
What a movie! Nowadays only technically bloated nonsense junk comes out of Hollywood.

If you know me, you're aware that for a few cheap laughs, I'll do just about
anything, so I reenacted the scene from the movie where
<LINK>https://youtu.be/gg1t_nGaDLs|Charlton Heston laughs maniacally.</LINK>
Just as I remembered it, of course, and camerawoman Angelika helped shoot the scene near
San Francisco's Ocean Beach. My brain is notoriously porous like a sieve, and
so something completely different came out naturally, but as always, it's at
least entertaining!

But back to the bunker ruins now found on this beach: The concrete half-circle
protruding from the sand in Figure (#1) is a segment of a so-called Tobruk.
<LINK>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_mount|Panama Mount</LINK>.

It consists of a platform made from concrete in the shape of a circle, on which
soldiers can roll around a giant cannon to point it in different directions. 
In this case, the gunners were firing towards attacking ships at sea, and the
position covers a full 180 degrees along the coastline. The weapon enthusiasts
among you can find detailed pictures on the
<LINK>http://www.militarymuseum.org/BtyBluff.html|Military Museum Website</LINK>.
Look at the black and white pictures of yesteryear to get a feel for how it
looked like when the whole thing was still under construction or then in
operation.

<pic images/funston-bunker.ps (#2) The bunker is still standing, parts have already fallen down the dune.>

The fortification, complete with cannon, was undoubtedly once anchored at the
top of the dune, and over the years it has tumbled down onto the beach. The
Pacific tides change twice a day here, washing huge amounts of sand around, so
that the platform sometimes is covered completely and sometimes stands out far
from the sand.

<pic images/ff-museum.ps On the website of the Military Museum, pictures from 1937 show the original fortifications.>

At the top of the dune, there is still an old concrete bunker (#2) from the
Second World War, and it's hanging there so loosely, that I always wonder when
it will fall down next (update: it fell down in July of 2023).  The authorities
responsible for beaches in California are usually scaredy cats who immediately
block off any dangerous areas, but the bunker is still freely accessible and
often times you an see overconfident people up there who are playing around on
it. Pride comes before the fall!

@Z: The Little Produce Store Around the Corner

<pic images/church-produce-bins.ps The display of the produce store "Church Produce" in our neighborhood.>

<em>Angelika</em> Most Germans know the concept of American corner stores
from various Hollywood movies, where customers can
quickly buy a few things at any time of day or night that they have just run out.
There is usually an interesting range of things to be purchased there
from beer to snacks, milk and sweets, but also flour and toilet paper.

<pic images/church-produce-inside.ps The store has everything, and you're done in a flash.>

In our neighborhood on Church Street, there is a wonderful little store of this
kind, but it is quite special, because at "Church Produce", you can find not
only a wide variety of fresh vegetables and fruits, great bread, but also dairy
products, pasta and coffee from small roasters. We are always amazed at how
well the store is stocked. Because here we also find our beloved Italian
Mortadella, which is not easy to find in the USA. The fruit and vegetables are
always of excellent quality and yet affordable.

<pic images/church-produce-pano.ps It's nice that our neighborhood still has small shops.>

The employees are always super friendly and give their customers the feeling
that they have known them for a long time. Since the store is located in our
neighborhood but is still 15 minutes away on foot from our apartment, we often
combine a shopping trip there with our daily walk. We hope that "Church
Produce" will stay, because running a small store in San Francisco is often a
big challenge. But the people in the neighborhood love the store, and it is
always well visited.

Greetings from San Francisco!

Angelika and Michael
