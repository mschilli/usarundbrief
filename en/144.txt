@Z: The recall of San Francisco's District Attorney

<em>Michael</em> I usually don't care about politics, except maybe when there's
something to laugh about. However, the fun of observing San Franciso politics has evaporated
completely in recent years, having to watch helpless feel-good politicians turning
the city into a lawless hellscape. When you can't buy a
bicycle anymore because it will be stolen immediately, or you can't park a car on
the street anymore because unchallenged thieves cut off the catalytic
converter in broad daylight, the fun stops eventually (USARundbrief reported).

Many others were in the same situation as us when we had to watch the San
Francisco District Attorney, Chesa Boudin, who was elected by the people for
four years, refuse to prosecute criminals arrested by the police. This kept
happening even for repeat offenders, the man obviously following a very absurd
and radical political ideology.  But eventually even the most tolerant citizens
of San Francisco were so fed up, that they demanded the dismissal of the
inactive prosecutor through a petition, only two years into his four-year term.
This "recall" procedure exists in the state of California for all kinds of
political offices, and even some of our governors have had to face a vote of no
confidence forced by the people. The signatures of angry citizens were
certified in November, and the actual recall vote was held on June 7, 2022.

When such referendums pile up, as is unfortunately the case in California, many
citizens simply don't bother to vote out of fatigue. Boudin was elected in 2019
with only a few votes ahead with a voter turnout of only 41%. However, in the
June 2022 recall, large parts of the city's population were so angry about the
prosecutor's missteps that 46% of them managed to cast their votes. 90% of them
voted by mail, 10% dragged themselves to one of the many polling stations
scattered across the city.

As is now common across politics, unfortunately no party today runs fact-based
election campaigns or can even accept a democratically targeted election result
when they're not the winner. Every week I found new leaflets in our mailbox,
mainly from Boudin's fanatical followers, in which it was dramatically
explained to me that anyone who voted for the recall must be a Republican! The
whole recall process was allegedly financed by billionaires, some of whom were
even connected to Republicans in Congress, the flyers said! Interestingly, San
Francisco is one of the most left-leaning cities in the USA, with about 5%
Republicans and 63% Democrats, so "Republican" is an insult that hardly anyone
will tolerate.

Furthermore, it must be mentioned that practically every election campaign here
in the USA is sponsored by wealthy citizens, who finance television and
internet ads and donate money for spectacular stage appearances with lots of
balloons. Even Boudin's anti-recall campaign was funded by wealthy citizens who
supported his politics. But on election day, of course, it was the citizens who
went to the polls, each with only one vote, regardless of whether they were
rich or poor.

With excitement, we followed the vote count after the polling boths had closed
in the evening hours of the day the votes were cast, and it quickly became
clear that Boudin had been ousted from office with a bang. A glance at the
<LINK>https://electionmapsf.com|election map</LINK> (Figure (#6)) made it clear
that purple-colored wealthy old hippie neighborhoods (Bernal Heights,
Haight-Ashbury, Noe Valley) and the Latin American Mission District wanted to
keep the district attorney. The residents of the green-colored neighborhoods,
who wanted to fire him, were composed of wealthy snobs (Pacific Heights,
Marina, Seacliff) and Asian working class (Sunset, Richmond, Excelsior), which
gave the edge due to the higher population count.

In his resignation speech, Boudin blamed wealthy Republicans who had funded the
recall with three times as much money as his own supporters. That he was simply
a bad fit for the job of District Attorney never occurred to him. You see,
when you lose an election nowadays, you don't look for the blame within yourself.
After all, you own the truth and everyone else is a fraud or simply crazy.
It's quite remarkable that democratic principles are no longer in demand with
the "Me! Me! Me!" generation, no matter if left or right.

The recall received surprisingly wide press coverage, and even though it was
only a city election, national news outlets such as CNN and the major daily
newspaper New York Times reported extensively on it. They all wanted to
recognize a political trend in the result. The magazine "The Atlantic" even
published a ten-page article titled

in San Francisco, documenting the decline of the city she once loved. Worth
reading!
