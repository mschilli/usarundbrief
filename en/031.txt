@Z: Car traffic in Silicon Valley

<em>Michael</em> 
The traffic on the two highways, 101 and 280, which lead from San
Francisco to the more southernly located Silicon Valley, has now
reached catastrophic proportions. The speed limit of 65 miles per
hour (about 100 km/h) on these four-lane highways (per direction!)
does mean that everyone drives roughly at the same speed, which is why
American highways generally handle much more traffic than German
ones, but too much is too much.

Between 7 and 9:30 in the morning and 5 and 7:30 in the evening, you
can no longer drive here. Instead of the record 35 minutes it once
took me to drive the 60 km from San Francisco to Mountain View (don't
try this at home, kids!), now it can take me up to an hour and a half during
rush hour to get to the office. And every time, it drives me crazy
that Americans can't drive. They can't handle the technical aspects of their
oversized cars. Americans also have no sense of what moves the
entirety of highway drivers forward. The focus is solely on the
individual car--at the slightest delay, they slam on the brakes,
causing the biggest traffic jam. Additionally, the plague of SUVs
(Sport Utility Vehicles, a mix of delivery and sports car) means
that as a driver of a normal low exposure car, you can hardly see anything.
Hopefully, the gas price will soon shoot up to five dollars so that
these idiots and their monstrosities disappear from my highway!

<pic images/gap.ps A huge (approximately 35 by 15 meters) billboard at the edge of the highway. Zoom in on the image and you'll see the four helmeted workers at the very top, securing the material!>

If any drivers is getting bored, they can look at the huge billboards lined up
along the edge of the highway. There, companies like Oracle,
Microsoft, or sometimes a clothing chain like Gap advertise their
products. Traffic planners also come up with the craziest things to
regulate traffic: for example, traffic lights at highway on-ramps
that turn green for exactly one second and then switch back to red.
This way, a car enters every 10 seconds, quickly merging into the
constant flow of traffic on the highway without causing anyone to
slam on the brake. Although this means a long wait at the entrance, once you're
on the highway, the traffic is flowing smoothly. At least in theory.

I have already mentioned the carpool lanes before: During peak hours,
only cars with two or more occupants (sometimes the limit is even
three) are allowed to drive in the leftmost lane, encouraging people
to form carpools. By the way, a child in a car seat also counts as a
passenger. A pregnant woman once even tried to argue before the
California Supreme Court that she should count as two people -- but
she was unsuccessful.

But even the carpool lane is congested in the morning hours. Instead
of getting upset pointlessly, I like to hop on my bike -- as I
mentioned in an earlier newsletter -- to ride to the train station, 
and take Silicon Valley railway to commute to work.

@Z: The Silicon Valley Railway

<em>Michael</em> 
The train from San Francisco to the more southernly located Silicon
Valley is called Caltrain and feels like a time travel back to the
year 1960. Over the last 40 years, Americans have invested everything
in highways and nothing in public transportation, which results in
the fact that even in the most successful high-tech area in the
world, train travel is still exactly like it was forty years ago:
with a diesel locomotive that the engineer pushes to a maximum speed
of about 80 km/h, constantly ringing a mechanically operated bell.
The train rattles like on the route from Kolkata to New Delhi. The
journey from San Francisco to Mountain View, which is about 60 km
further south, takes an hour. The trains run hourly, with slightly
more frequent service during peak times in the morning and evening.

<pic images/sfcal.ps At the "4th and King" train station in San Francisco>

<pic images/4th.ps The train is still empty.>

Every morning when leaving the San Francisco station, the conductor
announces over the loudspeaker that 1) smoking is not allowed (in
California, you can't smoke anywhere except on the street), 2) you
are not allowed to put your feet on the seats (which is an imposition
for Americans, as they tend to put their feet up everywhere, some even
put their feet on the conference table during meetings!), and 3) you
should not adjust the seats. These seats have backs that seemingly
allow you to adjust them to face forward or backward -- but if you
try, the backrest gets terribly stuck halfway, making the seat
unusable and requiring the carriage to go into maintenance. I laugh
myself half to death every time an American, who has never taken a
train in their life, tries it and spends the rest of the journey
trying to fix the backrest. No one has ever succeeded; it's hopeless.
At the station, people often ask me if you know where to buy tickets. There
are Americans my age who have never taken a train in their life. And
I'm not getting any younger!

The conductor remembers whose ticket he has already punched by
hanging a small card over the corresponding seat. If you change seats
because your neighbor is snoring or smells of alcohol, you have to
take the card with you and move it, otherwise the conductor will ask
for your ticket again the next time he comes through. By the way, why
don't train conductors in Germany remember it this way and runs through with
"Shift change, tickets please?" instead? Incidentally, changing seats is a
typical American phenomenon that I have never found described in
literature and that I want to discuss today: People here, on the bus,
tram, or train, tend to change seats unexpectedly. In Germany, if your seat
neighbor gets up and moves three rows ahead, you think, "Did I eat
garlic yesterday or what?" I have often noticed in Munich that I
stayed in my seat even if it was drafty, smelly, or the sun was
glaring--just to not offend my seat neighbor. Here, it's not uncommon
for people to change seats three times if they are traveling ten
stops. Mysterious America! You read it first in the newsletter!

<pic images/station.ps Two passengers are waiting for the "Caltrain" train.>

In America, by the way, employees cannot deduct commuting expenses
from their taxes. If you live far from work, it's your own fault.
However, Netscape pays each employee $30 a month if they use public
transportation to get to work. You receive a check that can only be
cashed by train, bus, and subway operators. This only covers about
a quarter of the costs, but it's at least a step in the right
direction. Additionally, Netscape offers a shuttle (a private bus)
that picks people up from the train station and takes them to work.
In Mountain View, private buses arrive in the morning with
"Netscape," "Microsoft," or "Hewlett Packard" written on them. Public
transportation in Silicon Valley is practically useless; I've never
seen a bus going anywhere I wanted to go. I would never get on the
Microsoft bus, of course; I would rather walk the three kilometers to
Netscape in torrential rain.

The one-way trip from San Francisco to Mountain View costs four
dollars. If the station has a ticket counter but you buy the ticket
out of laziness from the conductor on the train, it costs an extra
dollar. In Germany, this is quite normal. But anyone who thinks an
American would accept this is mistaken: If the conductor asks for the
extra dollar and politely explains why, there are regularly people
who get upset and start lengthy discussions! Some conductors simply
no longer charge the additional dollar because it doesn't really show
up in the evening's accounting; after all, the passenger could just
as easily have boarded at a station with no ticket booth. There
are only three stations with ticket booths between San Francisco
and San Jose, which is 90 kilometers further south! As we hear,
ticket machines are supposed to be introduced soon everywhere! Wonders of
technology!

By the way, no one is expected to deal with any confusing zone
systems here like in Germany. In illustration (#6), you can see a 10-ride ticket (costs
$34, saving 15%) that shows "Zone 4." But that's only for the
conductor; no passenger would know that. Instead, you simply tell the
ticket counter person where you want to go. It's also straightforward in the
subway: you pay the same price ($1.10) throughout the entire city,
and if you want to go to the suburbs, every ticket machine indicates
how much it costs to go where. No one is required to abstract
themselves into any complicated grid or zone systems.

<pic images/ticket.ps (#6) A ten-ride ticket for the Caltrain from San Francisco to Mountain View. 34 dollars!>

Bringing a bicycle onto the train, as I have written before, is often
an incredible source of frustration, especially when the bicycle car
is full, which is when you're not allowed to board, and you have to wait half an
hour or an hour for the next train. Some conductors allow more than
the maximum number of bicycles on board, and there usually
are no problems with that. But if a conductor is strict and leaves people standing
outside, they get a lot of flak from the cyclists. Here in
California, it's common to be flexible when the situation requires
it. Anyone who blindly follows silly rules is considered a fool. I
still remember Munich, where it's a regulation that buses must have
"contact" with the bus stop sign, meaning they can't stop beforehand,
for example when traffic conditions would allow it.
Here in San Francisco, a bus might stop well before the stop
depending on the traffic situation, and then you just quickly walk
between stalled cars to get on, no problem at all. Recently, a bus driver
didn't open the door beforehand when traffic came to a halt and drove
all the way to the bus stop sign. People couldn't stop complaining
about it!

By the way, someone who is very meticulous, as I have mentioned
before, is called a "Nazi." The first time I heard this was on the TV
show "Seinfeld," where it was about a soup vendor who always harassed
people and was colloquially called the "Soup Nazi." If someone from
the Seinfeld crew didn't follow the soup nazi's rather arbitrary rules, he simply
wouldn't sell them soup and would yell with his Argentine accent: "No
soup for you! Come back next year!" But the soup was so good that
people came in droves and allowed themselves to be harassed. I laughed
tears!

<pic images/cell.ps Another chatterbox on the phone>

Many people are typing away on their laptop computers during train rides,
which is okay. But, to my dismay, there is too much mobile phone use.
I've heard that, by now, everyone in Germany has a mobile phone too. I
also have one because it's practical if my bike has a flat tire or if
I miss the last bus. But I would never think of making a phone call
on the train, where everyone can hear what I'm saying! I don't know
why, but when someone next to me is on the phone, it annoys me more
than if they were talking to their neighbor. Probably because the
protocol is so predictable: "Hello, this is...!" ... "Good, and you?"
... "Hey, I'm on the Caltrain!" ... "So, I have to go now!" ...
Arrrgh! I would be a regular in mobile phone-free carriages! By the
way, more and more fine restaurants here are starting to note on
their menus that a) smoking and b) letting mobile phones ring is not
allowed.

<pic images/mvcal.ps The train arrives in Mountain View.>

In Mountain View, through years of pioneering work, I've discovered a
route from the train station to Netscape that goes over a few bridges
designated only for bicycles and through parks, instead of following
the congested main roads. Initially, I asked colleagues based in
Mountain View if such a route existed, but received negative
responses, as no one in Mountain View is riding a bike or walks. In
suburban America, people tend to drive even for small errands, like
buying bread, even if the supermarket is only 100 meters away from
their home.

<pic images/bikebridge.ps (#9) The bicycle bridge over the highway in Mountain View>

In the Los Angeles area, this sometimes leads to the police
stopping and checking pedestrians, as no "normal" person walks. As a
result, locals are familiar with every car shortcut that involves
briefly getting on and off three highways, but they know nothing
about routes through parks where you can zip through on a bike like
lightning. Going on a tangent, I firmly believe that Mountain View has the slowest
traffic light in the Northern Hemisphere. At the intersection of
Central Expressway and Moffett Boulevard, it surely takes five
minutes to change!

<pic images/cube.ps My bicycle with helmet in my cubicle>

But in Mountain View, there is actually a bicycle bridge that goes
over highway 85 (Figure (#9)). In winter, by the way, it is pitch
dark there by 6 PM, and in the park through which I ride after work,
there is no light anywhere. My bicycle only has a blinking light,
which makes me visible but does not illuminate my path. The result
is a 1.5 km long blind ride through the park, and every rustle in the
bushes makes me pedal faster. It gets my adrenaline pumping, and I
wouldn't stop for anything or anyone!

@Z: The Streets of San Francisco

<pic images/pole.ps A historic event on June 9, 2001: The "PERL MAN" in pole position.>

<em>Michael</em> 
Apart from the unbearable traffic conditions, there is another reason
why I don't like to move our car: It is very difficult to find a
parking spot in San Francisco. Since we don't have a garage, if one
of us comes home with the car after seven in the evening, we
sometimes have to drive around the block for up to half an hour to
find a spot. If we happen to have parked the car near our apartment,
we think twice about moving it again. Parking spots are evaluated
based on street cleaning days -- a "Monday parking spot" has to be
vacated on Monday because that's when the street sweeper comes.
Getting a Monday parking spot on a Tuesday, where the car can
theoretically stay for a whole week, is considered a superhuman
achievement, often celebrated with champagne. On the other hand, if
you park your car late on Tuesday evening on a 7 AM Wednesday parking
spot due to lack of alternatives, you might as well go to bed wearing
a fool's cap.

The best parking spot is, by the way, what I call the "Pole Position"
-- right in front of the house. ("Pole Position" is what they call
the best starting position in car races). We get this parking spot
extremely rarely, maybe once every three months. Then the car is only
moved if someone needs to go to the emergency room at the hospital.

Furthermore, you are not allowed to park near fire hydrants; you
have to keep a distance of about eight and a half feet or so. Back
when I obtained my California driver's license, I had to memorize
that, but by now, I don't remember it anymore. It always reminds me
of an old movie with the Marx Brothers, in which Groucho Marx had an
inflatable hydrant in the car that he would place on the sidewalk
when needed to scare away drivers parked in that spot. There's also
some rule about intersections, but it's not taken very seriously. The
actual rule is more like: if it doesn't directly harm anyone, it won't be
punished. In Germany, I once received a ticket for parking against
the direction of traffic--here, no one cares which way the car is
facing. What's important on steep streets is to turn the wheels in
such a way that if the gear slips and the handbrake fails, the car
rolls against the curb and stops there. If you don't do that, you'll
get a ticket because there have been serious accidents when old cars
started moving on their own and thundered down the hills. Angelika
always scolds me when I only gently turn the wheels and not, as the
lady wishes, so that they almost pop out of their sockets. However,
my dream is to one day get such a ticket, frame it, and hang it in
the bathroom.

<pic images/wrong.ps The wheels of the car in front are turned the wrong way -- it would roll into the street! The two cars behind it did it correctly.>

<pic images/parktick.ps A ticket for the car that turned its wheels the wrong way -- 23 dollars!>

A recent update: The other day, I wanted to drive to the office in
the morning, went over to 23rd Street where our car was parked, and
couldn't believe my eyes: On a 30% incline, there was a black Acura
Integra parked sideways on the sidewalk, right in front of a garage.
And the license plate read "PERL MAN"! An approximately
hundred-year-old woman was frantically moving around it, and a younger
gentleman, who could no longer get out of his garage because of it,
had just called the towing service. It turned out that while parking,
the woman had bumped into our car with her massive 1960s Oldsmobile
from above, causing our car to roll down the hill on its own, despite the
handbrake being engaged and the gear in place. Thanks to the wheels
being turned towards the curb as required (Angelika had parked), it
only hopped up the curb and came to a stop just before the garage.
The woman had kindly already tucked a note under my windshield wiper:
"Please ring 647-92.. -- will explain."
Well, I would have been curious about that
explanation. But luckily, I happened to be there, found that nothing much
had happened to our car (minor scratches don't count in America),
whereupon the woman thanked me with "Thank you for being so nice."
The garage guy quickly canceled the tow truck, I drove the car off
the sidewalk, and headed off to work in Mountain View as usual. In
all the excitement, I unfortunately had forgotten to photograph the scene.
You experience things in this city!

<pic images/note.ps The note from the woman who pushed our car down the hill.>

@Z: Radar Traps

<pic images/hydrant.ps A rowdy teenager parked his pickup truck at
the fire hydrant!>

<em>Michael</em> 
I had already written that on California highways, the speed limit is usually
65 miles per hour (100 km/h). However, on weekdays, outside of rush
hours, hardly anyone adheres to this limit -- 85 mph (130 km/h) is
more common. You can do this safely as long as you're not the only
speeder on the road, because in America, there are no speed cameras.

Instead, a police officer in an officially marked patrol car has to
park on the side of the highway, measure a passing car's speed with a radar
gun, chase the speeder, catch them, pull them over, and issue a
ticket by hand. This takes a good 20 minutes, so if there are maybe 5
patrol cars between San Jose and San Francisco, the chance of getting
caught speeding is almost zero. You usually see the police car from a
distance, and then the whole line of cars magically slows down, only
to speed back up to 85 shortly after.

It's only dangerous to drive
faster than everyone else or to keep changing lanes. That stands
out, and it can also happen that a police car or motorcycle cop comes up
from behind faster than everyone else. In that scenario, you need to be
careful and keep an eye on the rearview mirror. If it does happen
that a "Ford" brand car, model "Crown Victoria," with flashing lights
is following you, you should immediately pull over to the right and
stop on the shoulder, even on the highway, if it's safe to do so.
It's also very important to stay calm and not get out of the car, as
police officers in America are allergic to any kind of sudden
movements. When the officer gets out and approaches the car (on the
highway, by the way, they approach on the passenger side), you roll down the
window, and if he says "License and registration please," you hand
over your driver's license and vehicle registration. If the latter is
in the glove compartment, it's advisable to open it with a quick hand
movement -- but only if you want to hear the sound of a cocking
hammer and look into the barrel of a handgun. By the way, police
officers in the US don't collect any fines; that is done via a transfer, and any
waving of cash is considered bribery, so be careful. If you receive a
"ticket" for speeding, you get penalty points in California, which
not only go on your driving record but are also 100% certain to be
reported to your auto insurance. The insurance then promptly raises
the premium. However, you can work off the points by attending
traffic school. Usually, this involves sitting in a classroom for a
few hours on a Saturday, listening to accident statistics and driving
tips, but recently, in some counties, you can also work through a
traffic rules catalog online, take a test in the form of a webpage,
and if you pass, have the points removed. That's progress!

@Z: Parking in the City

<pic images/wespe.ps The evil parking ticket wasp followed by the street sweeper!>

<em>Michael</em> 
Regarding our parking situation: In San Francisco, a street sweeper
truck comes by on most streets once a week. During this time, parking is not
permitted, as the sweeper needs to pass through without obstruction.
Therefore, it's important to always check the displayed street cleaning signs
before parking your car. Each street has its own cleaning schedule.
For example, on the east side of Church Street, where we live, it's
Wednesday from 8 to 10 in the morning. On the west side, it's Monday,
also from 8 to 10. On the north side of 23rd Street, it's Friday from
12 to 2 in the afternoon. On the south side, it's Tuesday, also from
12 to 2 in the afternoon. The street sweeper usually comes by right
in the middle of the two-hour window, accompanied by some ticketing
officers who issue $30 tickets for each parked car--but only
immediately before the sweeper passes through. Once the sweeper has
gone by, you can park again on that side right away, even if the two-hour period
hasn't passed yet.

However, 22nd Street down to Church St is so steep at 31.5% that no street
sweeper can drive there. And the trash rolls down the hill on its own! That's
why you can always park there. However, parking your car at 90 degrees as required,
and it'll end up sitting at a disturbing angle, and
would likely tilt during an earthquake. If you go on vacation for a week,
you need to find someone to keep moving your car around according to the schedule.

<pic images/park.ps Reckless parking in Noe Valley. Street cleaning is scheduled on this street on Wednesday, between 8 and 10.>

<pic images/plan.ps How we remember where the car is parked.>

Since our car is often parked five minutes away from the house, I
tend to forget exactly where it is. Who was the last person to come
home with the car and when? Where is the parking spot this time?
That's why Angelika once went through all the streets in the
neighborhood, noted down the respective cleaning times, and manually
created a nice plan that now hangs on our door. An oversized thumbtack
always indicates where the car is currently parked at and whether the
street sweeper is coming by today.

@Z: Public Transportation

<pic images/bart.ps The subway in San Francisco: BART>

<em>Michael</em> 
San Francisco also has a public transportation system called the "San
Francisco Municipal Railway," or "MUNI" for short. Bus lines with
numbers and streetcars with letters (J, K, L, M, N) transport people
above ground. The line that passes by our house on Church Street is
called J-Church. By the way, there is a fairly well-known alternative
rock band in the USA named "J-Church." The music might be rather
ungrounded, but guess which city they come from?

There's also a subway: the so-called 'BART', which stands for "Bay
Area Rapid Transit". However, one shouldn't imagine it as a subway
network like those in European metropolises. Instead, there is
exactly one line from Daly City (south of San Francisco) up to the
Bay Bridge, to continue under the Bay. On the other side (in the East Bay),
it continues in various directions. While BART is much more reliable
than the MUNI, it still doesn't run as regularly as its European
counterparts: on weekdays during the day, it might run every 10
minutes, but on Sundays and public holidays, you might end up waiting
around at the subway station for 20 minutes and more.

@Z: Dogs, Dogs, Dogs!

<pic images/dog.ps Dog owner in San Francisco. The gentleman is holding a bag with the dog poop in his left hand.>

<em>Michael</em> 
When you're on foot, you no longer have to worry about being ambushed
by some wild street gang members -- San Francisco has become very
tame lately. Instead, there's a new nuisance: Recently, while I was
training for the marathon and running through the "Glen Park"
neighborhood, I encountered a woman pushing a stroller, and a dog. The
dog was a completely unremarkable-looking like a Collie (like Lassie), and I
unsuspectingly ran past the trio. Suddenly, the unleashed mutt
snapped at my calf and bit into it!

<pic images/poop.ps Here are free plastic bags for dog poop (from the newsletter correspondent in San Diego).>

I barked a few words at the woman that were shocking even by American
standards (see the newsletter before last on freedom of speech) and
ran on, only to realize shortly after that I was actually bleeding!
Fortunately, the tetanus shot I had received six years ago in Munich was
still effective. Funnily enough, a somewhat more tragic incident
involving a fighting dog had occurred a few weeks earlier in San
Francisco: In a high-rise building, a leashed fighting dog had
snapped at a neighbor's neck and killed her! The two owners were then
charged with attempted murder or manslaughter because they had
allegedly trained the animal that way. I realized I could have easily gotten
millions out of the stupid cow with the unleashed collie, but I am
generous and do not sue mentally challenged people.

Generally speaking, dog owners are a bit eccentric. If a dog poops on
the sidewalk, the owner must clean it up immediately, or else they
face fines. People use a transparent crinkly bag, which they bring
with them, to cover their hand, then they reach into the -- I
speculate -- still body-warm clay-like droppings, pull the bag off
like a glove, and wrap it around the brown giant. Well, to each their
own. This does have the advantage that in America, you rarely step in
dog poop -- in four and a half years, I've only had a stinky lump on
my shoe once. But that's not all there is to say about dogs.
Angelika, take it away!

<em>Angelika</em> 
Not only since Michael was bitten by a dog have I been observing the
dog epidemic in San Francisco with suspicion. Until now, I have held back
with my comments, thinking that I might be suffering from selective
perception. I am simply afraid of dogs. Dog owners also make me
uneasy, as they always claim their Fido is the most peaceful. Even if
Hasso is baring his teeth and pulling on the leash. I am one of those
people who often cross the street just to move in a "dog-free" zone.
This is becoming increasingly difficult in San Francisco.

Walking up
24th Street in our neighborhood "Noe Valley" (or is it perhaps
already "Dog Valley"?) on the weekend is no easy task for a
dog-phobic person like me. Every three meters (I'm not exaggerating),
you stumble over a dog surrounded by a crowd of people: "Oh, isn't he
beautiful!" "What's his name?" "Can I pet him?" Many shop owners also
have their dogs with them during the day. A nightmare for people like
me who love to shop but prefer to avoid every dog. That's why I don't
enter the new boutique on 24th Street called "A Girl and Her Dog."
They do sell very nice clothes, but, you guessed it, I would also
have to deal with the shop owner's dog. A few doors down at
"Tully's," a small street cafe, you'll find a water-filled dog bowl and
a friendly note that they have small treats for four-legged friends
inside the cafe.

<pic images/girldog.ps The boutique "A Girl and her Dog," which Angelika is boycotting.>

San Francisco loves its dogs. I am no longer alone in this
observation. Just in May, I read an article in the "San Francisco
Chronicle" that extensively reported on this "crazy love"
and raised the question of when the humanization of dogs began. The
concept of the dog as man's best friend is not exactly new, but the
services for dogs and stressed dog owners that are mushrooming in and
around San Francisco are.

I'm not talking about the traditional dog
boarding facilities that take care of the beloved four-legged friend
when the owners are on vacation. I've long gotten used to the many
professional dog walkers, who can be recognized by the cluster of
dogs that always surrounds them (which always reminds me of the Pied
Piper of Hamelin). The latest establishment is day care centers for
dogs, called "Doggie Day Care." Since Americans--and employees of
Silicon Valley in particular--are known to work a lot, man's best
friend often stays home alone for many hours. This triggers the dog
owner's guilty conscience. The solution: you take your dog to
dog kindergarten. Don't think I'm crazy. The "Doggie Day Cares" actually
have a lot in common with a kindergarten. There are toys, sofas for
resting, and often a playground-like outdoor area.

They go out for walks,
groom, pet, and train the dogs, and if necessary, even celebrate the
dog's birthday. Kennel-like structures are, of course, absolutely
taboo, as the dogs are supposed to interact with each other. Some
"Doggie Day Cares" even install web cameras so that the working dog
owner can check via the internet from the office how their
four-legged friend is doing. However, "Doggie Day Cares" are not
cheap. "Every Dog Has Its Day Care Inc." charges $395 monthly if the
dog is registered for three months, $345 monthly if it's six months
(www.everydog.com). At "K9to5" (www.k9to5.com) in San Francisco, it
costs $32 per day for an adult dog, $300 for 10 visits, or $455 per
month. The whole thing has become so popular that there are waiting
lists. Of course, not every dog is accepted. Unsocial or even
aggressive dogs are excluded. Therefore, dog owners and their dogs go
through an admission process. An interview is scheduled. I know this
firsthand because my photography teacher's dog was rejected because
it didn't fit into the dog group.

<pic images/water.ps Water for doggy in the store.>

"Doggie Day Cares" are not only extremely popular in San Francisco and
its surroundings, but they can also be found elsewhere in the USA.
However, San Francisco claims to have started the movement. The
private organization "San Francisco Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals" (SPCA), which is funded solely by donations,
launched the first "Doggie Day Care" as a pilot project in 1994. This
animal-loving society (SPCA) is heaven on earth for
dogs and cats. It has been advocating for animal rights in San
Francisco since 1868. Today, the SPCA ensures that abandoned, stray,
or neglected animals are not killed but are nursed back to health and
rehabilitated so they can live in families rather than shelters. Even
fighting dogs are given a chance. However, since 1997, it has been
the policy that Pit Bulls are euthanized if their past is unknown.
Incidentally, in 1998, the SPCA opened an animal shelter that,
according to their own description,
<LINK>https://www.sfspca.org/maddies.html>resembles the Ritz (Hotel)</LINK>).
Dogs and cats have their own rooms
with hardwood floors, sofas, aquariums, toys, and televisions. Rumor
has it that the shelter offered homeless people the opportunity to
stay with the animals some time ago, which the homeless thankfully
refused indignantly. Sometimes one wonders at the things that exist.

Finally, two very current stories about dogs. On Tuesday, twelve
jurors in San Jose found Andrew Douglas Burnett guilty of animal
cruelty (in America, the names of defendants are boldly published in
the newspaper), which could mean up to three years in prison for him.
After a rear-end collision, in his anger, he dragged the dog of the
woman who caused the accident out of her car and threw it into
oncoming traffic, which the dog did not survive. Not that I want all
the animal rights activists to get upset with me now. Of course, I
find such behavior wrong, and it's right that he was held
accountable for it. I just wanted to report on the commotion this
case caused. Animal rights activists quickly raised $120,000 to
ensure the suspect would be appropriately sentenced (court
proceedings in America are expensive), which drew criticism because
the amount was far higher than the rewards offered for several open
cases of missing children combined. Some said that the priorities
here are somewhat misplaced. Many were also outraged that the dog
owner spoke on camera about her child/baby being brutally murdered.
Just to avoid any misunderstandings: she meant her dog.

Also on Tuesday, on the other side of the bay, in Richmond, three
freely roaming fighting dogs attacked a ten-year-old boy who was out
riding his new bicycle. The dogs injured the boy so severely that he
remains in critical condition. He not only lost both of his ears but
also suffered deep lacerations on his face, which will take years to
fully heal. What particularly shocked me was that in the neighborhood
where the dogs attacked the boy, it is quite normal for fighting dogs
to be roaming around. This incident, along with a few others, sparked a
debate about fighting dogs, similar to the one you had in Germany
some time ago. On both sides of the debate, the same arguments are
presented: that the real problem is the owners or the breeders who
breed the most aggressive dog breeds. But I wonder what on earth goes
through the minds of dog lovers for whom there is nothing better than
owning a fighting dog? Why not a peaceful Saint Bernard? That's not
normal!

@Z: Muni Street Cars and BART Subway

<em>Angelika</em> 
Michael's detailed report on transportation policy already revealed quite a
few secrets to you. I've always used public transit to conduct my
social studies. If you really want to get to know San Francisco, just
hop on a bus or street car. Many adventures await you. I'm not
talking about the world-famous Cable Car, because locals in San
Francisco generally don't use the Cable Car to get from point A to
point B. No, even the "locals" ride the Cable Car mostly for fun, often
with visitors in tow. Take the bus, tram, or BART if you want to
understand what makes this city tick. One of my favorite bus lines is
number 30 "Stockton," because this bus goes right through Chinatown,
and you can feel firsthand that San Francisco has the largest Chinese
population outside of China. But be careful! The bus is always
packed, so it's not for those who suffer from claustrophobia. Going from
Asia to South America? That's just a stone's throw in San Francisco. Hop
on bus No. 14 "Mission," which takes you past taquerias and a
colorful mix of shops through the Latin American neighborhood (called
"The Mission"). You'll encounter colorful characters on bus number
48, which departs almost right outside our door. The reason for the
extravagance is rather sad, as the bus line passes by the "General
Hospital," which has a crisis intervention center for psychiatric
patients. Patients are treated at this center even if they are
uninsured.

TODO

I am also often a passenger on the "J" streetcar, as it takes me from
the city to Church Street, where we live. It always gets interesting
when school is out and the students from "Mission High" board at
Dolores Park. The reputation of this high school leaves much to be
desired, and I often feel sorry for the teachers when I observe the
students' behavior, even though I'm not particularly sensitive about
such things due to my profession. Recently, I was quite surprised
when suddenly some girls from this school, about 13 or 14 years old,
entered the streetcar with life-sized baby dolls in their arms. Since
Americans are known for their love of conversation, I didn't have to
wait long before someone asked the girls what the dolls were all
about. It turned out that the "baby doll project" is a type of sex
education. The girls (I didn't see any boys armed with baby dolls)
take the dolls home over the weekend. The homework is to take care of
the "baby." To make the experience more realistic, the dolls have a
computer chip installed that makes them cry at irregular intervals
for extended periods (including at night, of course). Thanks to
technology, the "baby" also starts crying if it is held awkwardly,
for example, with its head down. However, you can't feed the doll,
and the diapers stay clean. The girls keep a diary over the weekend,
writing down how they feel when their baby cries. One of the
passengers then asked a pedagogically valuable question to one of the
girls about what they were supposed to learn from this. She received
the answer: "To take on more responsibility!" WRONG! Ideally, the
crying of the babies is supposed to annoy the girls so much that they
resist sex for a long time and don't get pregnant. I immediately felt
that the baby project is not the right way to reduce the high number
of teenage pregnancies in the USA. This approach is like putting the
cart before the horse, which is known not to work.

And now a little story that will make the inspectors of the Munich
public transport services perk up. We've mentioned before that the
Muni (you remember, that's the public transport service in San
Francisco) is not exactly super reliable. For quite some time now,
everyone who is anyone has been trying to improve the Muni. And I
admit that it's not as bad as it once was. There still isn't a proper
schedule for buses and streetcars, but the waiting times have
shortened somewhat. As part of these improvements, about six months
ago, it was introduced that passengers with a valid ticket are
allowed to board at any door of the bus or streetcar. A valid ticket
is considered to be a monthly pass or the so-called "transfer," which
you receive as proof when paying and use for possible transfers.
Until then, you could only board at the driver, where you paid or
showed your monthly pass or "transfer." Boarding and alighting took
forever with this procedure. Since humans are known to be creatures
of habit, the new boarding method was prepared for the long term.
There were brochures, loudspeaker announcements, and signs, because
passengers had to be drilled to always carry their "transfer" with
them from now on. Inspectors are also needed from now on, because
someone might just jump on the bus or streetcar without a ticket. The
concept of inspectors is relatively unusual in American cities with
public transport systems.

Usually, a turnstile or a person prevents you from fare dodging when
boarding. Inspectors seem suspicious to Americans, as they are
authorized to restrict individual freedom and impose fines.
Naturally, the inspectors wear uniforms so they can be easily
recognized. Sneaking onto the bus in plain clothes would be
considered an imposition by American passengers. I've already been
checked twice. The last time, it so happened that two passengers
couldn't show a ticket. I watched with interest to see what would
happen next. The passengers simply jumped to the tram driver and
paid. The inspector politely remarked that they should please pay
when boarding next time to avoid misunderstandings and so he wouldn't
have to impose a fine. Wow! I remember the story from Munich with an
American tourist who took the S-Bahn from the airport to the city and
forgot to validate his ticket. He was checked and had to pay the
fine, even though it was obviously a mistake. Sometimes San Francisco
really shows its extremely friendly side.

@Z: News from the President

<em>Angelika</em> 
This month, our "Mr. President" embarked on a trip to Europe. As we
heard and read, Bush did not exactly cover himself in glory, as he
lived up to the ugly image of the stubborn, unyielding Texan cowboy
who prioritizes his friends in the oil industry above all else.
Environmental protection? Never heard of it! This lack of
environmental awareness is also causing Bush to lose face
domestically. The Kyoto Protocol may be an unfamiliar term to many
Americans, but the fact that Bush wants to drill for gas in Alaska or
that he reversed the law reducing the maximum levels of arsenic in
drinking water (initiated by Clinton) angers many. Therefore, before
his trip to Europe, Bush showed some concern for the environment by
visiting two national parks (the "Everglades" in Florida and the
"Sequoia National Park" in California). Will that help?

Even California is not speaking well of Bush at the moment. Bush is
ignoring the ongoing energy crisis in California and is refusing any
assistance, even though, on a global scale, California represents the
sixth-largest economy, a not insignificant state for the nation. The
energy crisis is already showing economic impacts. And economic
growth is supposedly Bush's top priority. He argues against the Kyoto
Protocol, claiming that the agreement would supposedly ruin the
American economy. Many believe that his disregard for California is
solely because the state is firmly in the hands of the Democrats, and
Bush cannot expect any votes from California. As is well known, Bush
belongs to the Republican Party.

And even within his own party, not everything looks rosy for Bush.
You might have heard of the American Senator James Jeffords, who left
the Republican Party in May after almost a lifetime of membership and
now acts as an independent in the U.S. Senate. The national and
international press reported extensively on this bold move because
his departure from the party changed the majority balance in the U.S.
Senate. The Democrats now hold 50 seats and the Republicans 49.
Although this is still almost a tie, the shift in the majority
balance means that the Democrats will now hold most of the committee
chair positions, which clearly changes the political landscape. The
chairpersons of the various committees, among other things, determine
the topics that are addressed in the committees. The Senate
leadership also shifted to a Democrat, Tom Daschle.

James Jeffords, by the way, chose independence because he no longer
wanted to support the changes in the Republican Party that had been
emerging for several years and were intensifying under Bush.
Traditionally, the Republican Party, dating back to Abraham Lincoln,
included many more liberal figures who were respected and heard by
the more conservative party members. Nowadays, the Christian
fundamentalist right dominates the party with Bush at the helm.
Politicians like James Jeffords or John McCain are being pushed to
the sidelines. When you look at what Jeffords stands for, you can
hardly believe he once belonged to the Republicans. He supports
environmental protection and abortion rights, as well as stricter gun
laws, and he opposes any discrimination against homosexuals. He also
holds the record for having voted against his own party on many
important issues. It should be noted in passing that American
politicians generally submit much less to party discipline. This
independence is seen quite positively. What matters is their own
conscience and the welfare of the state they represent. Incidentally,
Jeffords is the senator of the small state of Vermont, which, like
its senator, is making waves with liberal initiatives. Vermont, for
example, is the first American state to grant homosexual couples the
same rights and responsibilities as married couples (at the state
level) if they register as a partnership (the term "marriage" is not
officially used here either). A small sensation!

Yes, and Mr. Bush is also facing some trouble at home. His two
daughters were caught in Texas buying and consuming alcohol in a bar,
even though they are not yet 21 years old. The German press pointed
out that Bush introduced this strict age limit as the governor of
Texas. That's not entirely true. The age limit for buying alcohol is
21 almost everywhere in the USA, including in California. However, it
is true that Bush initiated a law in Texas that, under certain
circumstances, punishes those who are caught "under-age drinking"
three times with imprisonment.

So, Michael has been complaining the whole time that the newsletter
is getting way too long -- well, then I'll wrap it up. Just consider
it as summer reading!
