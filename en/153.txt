@Z: Hassle With the Health Insurance

<pic images/hc-shock.ps The shock comes with the doctor's bill.>

<em>Michael</em> Last summer, I had the dubious pleasure of having my meniscus,
which I tore playing soccer, surgically repaired. In Figure (#1), you can see
the total cost of this adventure. The hospital charged a whopping $43,696. However, our
health insurance had a deal with the place, so we got a discount of $27,775.55,
leaving $15,275.10, which the insurance actually paid. That means everything except
for the so-called "Copay," a deductible of $645.35, was charged to me as the
patient. What went on there?

<pic images/hc-bill-total.ps (#1) Hospitals services are very expensive.>

Health insurance companies in America offer, either through an employer or a government agency like
<LINK>https://www.coveredca.com/|Covered California</LINK>
various so-called "plans," which are insurance contracts at different costs.
Typically, the insured pays a monthly premium but often must also chip in a
co-payment for medical bills. For example, our co-payment is $30 for doctor
visits, but for more extensive procedures during hospital visits, it's a hefty
10% of the bill, up to an annual maximum of $2,000. This is intended to
motivate patients to minimize visits to the doctor or other costs. For plans
with lower deductibles, the insured must pay correspondingly higher monthly
premiums.

Under our plan, until we reach the yearly maximum (in the example, $2,000 per
year), each doctor visit costs us $30. So, if the insurance company agrees to
pay the doctor $400 for a 10-minute visit (which is not unusual as health costs
are out of control), because that's the negotiated rate between the doctor and
the insurance company, the insurance later transfers only $370 to the doctor.
The remaining $30 must be collected by the doctor from the patient. This is
usually handled at the reception desk, where the patient typically pays the owed
amount by credit card in advance, before even seeing a doctor. However,
sometimes the staff forgets to collect the copay, and a few weeks later, the
delighted patient receives a bill for $30 by mail, which they can also usually
pay by credit card.

<pic images/hc-pay.ps At the doctor's office, the patient initially pays their co-payment by credit card.>

During my aforementioned operating room visit last year, the hospital's finance people
mysteriously estimated the cost of the surgery at $9,000, and a few days
before the appointment, they charged me 10% of that amount, or $900, which I paid
by credit card, to give the go-ahead for the surgery. However, in the meantime,
several charges from various other service providers had been filed with the
insurance: the radiologist wanted money, as well as the treating orthopedist
who had recommended surgery after an also expensive MRI. Quickly, my annual
maximum amount of $2,000 had been reached. Hooray?
That's why, later, despite the higher-than-estimated surgery costs ($15,275.10 instead
of $9,000), the insurance calculated my co-pay not as $900, but only as $645.35.
Wait a minute, so had I overpaid the hospital by $254.65?

Now, it must be said that many Americans wouldn’t bother to check this, but you might have heard
that I once called eBay to get a refund of 10 cents that those crooks had
overcharged me. So, I called the hospital, navigated through a thousand menu
options, and asked if I would get my money back. No, they told me, I was lucky
because the insurance had negotiated a lower amount. Apparently, the finance
person on the phone had no clue because, according to my research, my insurance had
reimbursed the hospital the requested amount except for exactly $645.35, which
I was willing to contribute, but not a penny more. The hospital lady advised me
to call my health insurance to clear up the matter.

<pic images/check-mailman.ps The refund check came by mail.>

I got right on it. Since our health insurance is still managed through my old
employer, the staff there are incredibly sharp, quite different from what one
typically expects of health insurances in America. The employee on the hotline
immediately saw the problem and, while I was still on the phone, contacted the
hospital. Apparently, the billing department there got an earful because, after
a few minutes, I received the pleasing news that the hospital would of course
refund my money immediately.

What do we learn from this? Not even billing departments of hospitals know
how to bill correctly. Most patients are also overwhelmed by the regulations or
unwilling to familiarize themselves with them, and out of ignorance, they leave
their hard-earned money on the table. The service providers may even factor
this in and keep quiet if the patient overpays, while in the opposite case,
they of course immediately pull all levers to receive the cash.

So, as always in America: Keep calling until everything is correct. Be friendly
but assertive, never scold, but patiently explain the situation and maybe even
inject a bit of humor. After all, the people on the other end of the line are
just humans doing a tedious job and yearning for some entertainment. At the
same time, you get to improve your English and negotiation skills for free.

Anyways, four weeks later, a letter from the hospital arrived in our mailbox
via snail mail, with a cover letter that defiantly claimed that an 'Internal
Audit' conducted by the hospital had discovered that too much money had been taken from
me. Enclosed was a check for the exact $254.65 I had disputed. Life is full of
coincidences.

@Z: Trouble with Amazon

<pic images/amzn-malta.ps Letters from Malta with strange payment reminders from amazon.de>

<em>Angelika</em>
In November 2023, two dubious letters from amazon.de landed in our snail mail
mailbox with a postmark from Malta and a letterhead with the Amazon logo, which
wasn't even in color. Allegedly, I had ordered something from Amazon, but the
direct debit could not be processed, and I now supposedly owed Amazon 101 euros each,
which I was requested to promptly transfer to the banking institution HSBC
Trinkhaus and Burkhardt.

Neither letter said precisely what I had allegedly ordered. Also, it was
strange that I had received two separate letters with the exact same demand,
both sent to my American address. Sadly, nowadays, scammers are becoming
increasingly cunning. By now, it's well-known that one should not respond to
any payment requests via email or SMS. So, I suspected that this must be a new
snail mail scheme to scam people.

And since I don't have a German Amazon account but only an American one, and
there were no strange orders there, Michael and I initially ignored the letters,
believing it to be a bold attempt at fraud. I did some research on the internet
and found that other Amazon customers had experienced the same thing. There
were two explanations for these letters: first, that the letters were not
genuine. The second, more concerning explanation suggested that someone was
using my data to set up an account in my name on Amazon, but with incorrect
banking details. It's still not entirely clear to me how this could
be exploited, but let me highlight the absurdity that Amazon in Germany allows
customers to shop both by invoice and direct debit, and seems little interested
in closing the fraud opportunities that this opens up.

<pic images/amzn-reminder.ps Amazon.de reminds me of an order that never took place.>

You guessed it, the story continues. In February, again via a grey envelope sent
from the tiny country of Malta, a letter arrived from the debt collection
agency Riverty.  Here, too, it wasn't clear whether it was a very good forgery
or a legitimate claim. According to the internet, Amazon actually does work
with this collection agency. With debt collection firms, you always get the
impression that they are essentially an arm of the Mafia. The letter was also
full of red flags, such as the suggestion that I could set up a SEPA direct
debit mandate and then the collection agency would take care of everything, and
I would have no hassle.

Now, I know that you shouldn't randomly call any phone numbers listed on such
letters, as they might also link to scammers. So I thought, first I would
contact amazon.de to see if they could help, because an internet inquiry
revealed that such letters should not be completely ignored due to the
possibility of identity theft.

So, I logged in with my American Amazon account credentials on
the German Amazon site and started a chat because I wanted to have something in
writing. I had only had positive experiences with Amazon's American customer
service up to that point; they are sharp and always solve problems immediately.
Naively, I thought that Amazon Germany applied similar standards.

<pic images/amzn-riverty.ps The debt collection company Riverty starts the chase.>

It initially took me three attempts before anyone understood what my problem
was and was willing to help me. At first, I wasn't even sure if I was speaking
to a machine or a person. The first piece of information I received was that I
had received the reminder due to a technical problem and should ignore the
email.

Wait, stop, you attentive readers noticed it. I hadn't received an email, but
two letters by mail! Then I was promised that my inquiry would be forwarded to
the appropriate department and that I would receive a copy of this inquiry and
could expect a response in 2-3 hours. Neither one happened.

On the next attempt, I was simply told that I had not paid for a so-called
Amazon Kids subscription and that was why I received the reminders. It goes
without saying that I had already explained to the lady named 'Meri' that I had
not ordered anything and did not have a German Amazon account. When I asked her
if she could at least tell me if someone had created an account in my name, she
wrote in the chat that she could not tell me that for data protection reasons.
That's just scream-worthy.

She also promised to forward my concern to the security department, and that they
would then contact me. I'm still waiting for that. On the third attempt, I
spoke with the agent Kirtiman Singh Rajavat, and he finally took decisive
action. He instructed me to send the reminders and the letter from the debt
collection agency to a special email address at Amazon, which I did. It was not
exactly confidence-inspiring that the request was full of typos, but I then
received a message that no further action was required on my part for the time
being.

Although I was again told that I would receive further feedback, I am still
waiting for it to this day. Madness! I am still not sure if the matter is now
closed or if I will soon receive a letter from a German court. Sometimes I
really long for the days when you could simply pay in cash for merchandize
in real stores.

@Z: Anza Borrego Desert

<pic images/ab-drive.ps The approach already sets the mood for the desert landscape.>

<em>Angelika</em> Anyone who works at a school like I do enjoys the benefit of
generously alotted vacation time, which is a real luxury in the USA. And now that Michael has
recently become a freelance programmer and surfer, and is therefore very
flexible with his time, we can use my vacations for traveling together.

Around Christmas, I had more than two weeks off, and we spent one of those
weeks driving down to the Anza-Borrego Desert, which is located about 85
kilometers northeast of San Diego. We had been there many, many years ago, and
had long intended to return. We packed our Honda Fit, affectionately called
Brummi, and zoomed down south, making a stop in Santa Barbara, where we also hadn't
been in ages.

<pic images/ab-bike.ps Angelika radelt auf der Landstraße durch die Wüste.>

Before we moved to the USA many years ago, I had a somewhat one-sided view of
desert landscapes, thinking: It's hot, there's a lot of sand, it never rains,
and hardly anything grows. Of course, that's not entirely true. The
temperatures are indeed brutal, especially in the summer months, but the plant
life is rich and very fascinating because it consists of particularly robust
plants that withstand the dryness and weather conditions. The same is true for
wildlife: In the Anza Borrego Desert, for example, there are lizards,
mountain lions, coyotes, and bighorn sheep.

<pic images/desert-yard.ps Residential house in the middle of the desert.>

It's true that it rarely rains in the desert, but nonetheless, they do record
precipitation during the winter months, about 6 inches, or approximately 150
millimeters, per year. For example, it was drizzling on the day we left. You
can best imagine the Anza-Borrego Desert as a mountainous terrain with hidden
canyons, but also magnificent expanses, a paradise for every hiker and nature
lover. What always fascinates me the most in the desert is how quiet it is. A
delight for city dwellers like us.

<pic images/ab-apache.ps The AirBnB rental came with a horse.>

We rented a great Airbnb in the town of Borrego Springs. The cottage was not
only superbly equipped but also extremely affordable by California standards,
which made me initially think there must be a catch. But there wasn't. There
was a horse living in a corral behind the house, but of course we weren't
required to take care of the horse. However, Apache Tears, as the horse was
named, always enjoyed some petting and attention, and contributed to our
holiday idyll in the desert. The accommodation also had bicycles for free use.
Since Michael couldn't go on long hikes every day due to his meniscus surgery,
but cycling was no problem, we were pleased to have this mode of
transportation.

<pic images/salton-sea-inn.ps A great pub in the middle of the desert.>

Despite the many years since our last visit, the desert landscape had
pleasingly not changed, and we were just as thrilled with the Anza Borrego
Desert as the first time. Borrego Springs had improved its culinary offerings,
though.  However, what really caught our eye were the huge metal sculptures
that stood out almost surreal against the blue sky throughout Borrego Springs.
They hadn’t been there during our first visit. Rusty dinosaurs, eagles, horses,
as well as prehistoric animals were now spread throughout the desert landscape.
There are 130 of these sculptures! How did these end up in the desert? What’s
the story behind them? An artist named Ricardo Breceda created these on behalf
of Dennis Avery since 2008. Dennis Avery was an American philanthropist whose
father had built the quite successful Avery company.

<pic images/bs-desert-bike.ps Riding through endless expanses by bicycle.>

The brand 'Avery' is as well-known in the USA as 'UHU' is in Germany. Avery
developed the first self-adhesive labels. The owner's son did not join the company
himself, but as an heir, he had a substantial amount of money. Having lived in
Borrego Springs with his own family for a long time and loving and wanting to
protect the desert landscape, he acquired quite a bit of land there. He then
met Ricardo Breceda and installed the idea of sculptures in the desert landscape, placing
them on his private land, which is open to the public.

<pic images/bs-sculpture-photo.ps Angelika snaps a photo of the metal sculpture.>

One can certainly debate the artistic value of these metal sculptures, but
Borrego Springs has definitely gained a new tourist attraction. And if the area
is kept free from being filled with houses because of it, I'm all for it. By
the way, Dennis Avery passed away in 2012 at the age of 71, but the sculptures
are now managed by a foundation. We toured the sculptures on our bicycles, as
the area is quite expansive, and felt like we were on a movie set.

@Z: Salton Sea

<pic images/salton-sea.ps Salton Sea: Artificial lake with too much salt>

<em>Angelika</em>
Right around the corner from the Anza Borrego Desert is
Salton Sea, an oversalted, practically dead lake, behind which tells the story of a major
environmental disaster. It's an unreal, fascinating, but also somewhat eerie
landscape in the middle of the hot desert. An area that once saw glorious times
with major Hollywood artists visiting, and nowadays attracts bohemians with interesting,
but often also tragic life stories.

Such areas also have a magical pull on me, so it was clear that we would make a
trip to Salton Sea from our base in Anza Borrego. But now what happened to the lake?
Even the lake's origin story is crazy. How does such a large lake
end up in the California desert? It was due to an oversight by an engineer.

<pic images/salton-billboard.ps Lonely billboard of the former resort>

First, you must know that a sophisticated and now very controversial canal
system, which taps into the Colorado River, irrigates farmland in Southern
California's Imperial and Riverside Valleys. Without such water sources, no
vegetables would grow on Californian fields. One of these canals, namely the
Alamo Canal, became clogged with mud around 1900, and it was not possible to
clear it. The farmers urgently needed the water and protested and pleaded with
the responsible company, the "California Development Company," to let the water
flow again.

Since the company was already on the verge of bankruptcy, their engineer
Charles Lockwood must have thought, everything's lost anyway, so I might as well make a
breakthrough at another location along the Colorado River and let the water flow
uncontrolled by dams through different channels to the farms in the
Imperial Valley. Naturally, this didn't go well for long, and in 1905, due to
heavy snowmelt, the Colorado River had high water levels. Because of the
overburdening of the canal system and further breaches, the river water flowed
unhindered into the Salton Sink for two years, forming the lake.

<pic images/salton-pub.ps The only pub in the village offers nice seating under the open sky.>

This inflow was stopped in 1907 by repair works. Now, however, the lake hasn't
had any natural inflow or outflow and its level has been maintained for decades
by agricultural wastewater. However, this wastewater carries pesticides and
other chemicals, making the lake practically completely saline. Its salinity is
higher than that of the Pacific Ocean! As the water level in the lake continues
to drop due to various environmental factors such as higher evaporation due to
rising temperatures and less wastewater inflow, the salinity continues to
increase, and chemicals that have accumulated in the mud of the lake bed over
decades are released. The air quality in this area is often poor, and diseases
such as asthma and cancer are increasing, not to mention the death of fish and
other species. The state of California has been trying to find a solution to
the problem for decades, but the responsible authorities and politicians cannot
agree on the right approach, and then they prefer to do nothing.

<pic images/salton-confessions.ps An artistic sculpture on the beach>

Strangely, in the 1950s and 60s, when the salinity of Salton Sea hadn't reached
today's levels yet, it was a popular excursion and swimming destination, with
resorts bearing such glamorous names as Bombay Beach. Day-trippers came from
Los Angeles and Palm Springs, bathed in the lake, zipped around on motorboats,
and even fished. Nowadays, that's a somewhat absurd notion.

<pic images/salton-palm-stumps.ps Salton Sea today is home to artists and bohemians>

Today, the area around Salton Sea is generally inhabited by bohemians and people who need
affordable, cheap housing. These enthusiastic residents fight to ensure that
the area is not forgotten. There is an annual art festival in Bombay
Beach with many art objects on the beach that then are simply kept there. Parts of
the area resemble old ghost towns with many abandoned and collapsed buildings. It's a
paradise for every photographer. Despite the harsh and toxic environmental
conditions, many birds, such as snow geese, settle by the lake. And there's
also a nice bar with the funny name 'Ski Inn' with a beautiful garden, where we
stopped by and enjoyed delicious hearty burgers. At places like Salton Sea, I
always find myself philosophizing about life in general and in particular.

@Z: New City Hiking Website: hikethiscity.com

<pic images/htc-web.ps The new website hikethiscity.com shows all of our urban hikes.>

<em>Michael</em> During the Covid lockdowns, we got into the habit of going for
a walk every day, and at that time you either couldn't leave the city or had to
quickly get a walk in before sunset, so I began to scope out intricate city hiking trails using
websites like Google Maps and Komoot.com. San Francisco offers not only the
well-known attractions for tourists, and even someone who has lived here for 20
years may not know every hidden staircase, urban hill, or mini-parks with
breathtaking views, whether in rustic working-class neighborhoods or luxury
districts built with old money.

<pic images/htc-sub.ps Each urban hiking trail comes with photos and a map.>

And so, for a while, I put together new city hiking trails almost daily behind
closed doors in stealth mode, which we then actually hiked, recorded, and
reviewed. From the very best, which led through winding alleys, crossed the
freeway on pedestrian bridges, or where you could admire beautiful old grand
villas or simply enjoy an elevated panoramic view over the entire city, I
created a coffee table book titled
<LINK>https://www.lulu.com/shop/mike-schilli/san-francisco-urban-hikes/hardcover/product-m2dqzr7.html|"San Francisco Urban Hikes"</LINK>,
a heavy, splendid glossy photo volume with maps for the routes.

<pic images/htc-komoot.ps On komoot.com or the Kommot app you can navigate the trails.>

But as you know, my production mill never stops, so recently it occurred to me
to throw the accumulated treasure all at once at the public’s feet by putting
it out on the web at <LINK>https://hikethiscity.com|hikethiscity.com</LINK>.
And just like that, 57 of the best hiking trails
in San Francisco are now online! So if you’re ever in the city, you can pick a
few trails and navigate through them with the free Komoot app, which the detail pages on the
website link to. You’ll be amazed!

<pic images/sfuh-cover.ps (#3) Your humble narrator on one of the urban hikes.>

Now you can guess where the cover photo in Figure (#3) was taken. Clearly in a
more urban area of San Francisco, with a pedestrian bridge over a busy street,
but with a wide view of the Bernal Heights and Potrero Hill neighborhoods. No
tourist has wandered there yet!

TODO

@Z: Toppprodukt: Das flexible Kabelrückgrat

<pic images/cable-vertebrae-high.ps Ist die Tischplatte oben, streckt sich das Rückgrat.>

<em>Michael</em> Ich tippe ja noch immer viel am Computer herum, schreibe Artikel,
mache Open-Source-Software, verfasse scharfzüngige Emails und Posts auf Social
Media. Im hohen Alter habe ich jetzt auch noch den Stehschreibtisch für mich
entdeckt. Beziehungsweise einen einstellbaren Tisch, der motorgetrieben nach
oben oder unten fährt, je nachdem, ob ich bei der Arbeit gerade sitzen oder stehen will.

<pic images/cable-vertebrae-low.ps Ist der Schreibtisch unten, windet es sich.>

Das Problem bei dieser flexiblen Einstellung ist allerdings, dass die Kabel,
die von der Steckdose zum Schreibtisch führen, für Monitor- und Rechnerstrom,
Netzwerkkabel, USB-Anschluss zum Scanner undsoweiter, sich nun im
runtergefahrenen Zustand des Schreibtischs recht lose auf dem Boden ringeln,
aber sich am Stehschreibtisch straffen müssen.  Außerdem sollte man um den
Schreibtisch herumgehen beziehungsweise mit dem Staubsauger schnell mal
durchsaugen können, und bei meinem bisherigen Setup hatten sich mangels
Kabelmanagement unter dem chaotischen Verhau schon dicke Staubmullen gebildet.
Unschön!

<pic images/cable-vertebrae-vacuum.ps Sogar der Staubsauger kann drunter durch.>

Durch Zufall entdeckte ich auf Amazon diese "Vertebrae" (Rückgrat) genannten
Kabelführungen, die, ähnlich wie eine Wirbelsäule, eine gebogene Form annehmen
ohne zu knicken, wenn man sie staucht. Die Glieder sind wie Wirbel frei
aneinander gehängt und erlauben die Rotation um eine Achse (nicht wie die
Wirbelsäule in zwei Dimensionen!). Das reicht aber, damit bis zu einem halben
Dutzend Kabel schön aufgeräumt innerhalb der Wirbel bleiben und bei Amazon
gibt's das Produkt von mehreren Anbietern so um 35 Dollar. Ich hab's bei Ebay
bei einem Chinesenversand für etwas mehr als 20 bekommen. Jeden Cent wert, so
sauber war mein Arbeitszimmer noch nie, seit ich mit unserem ebenfalls
brandneuen Dyson-Staubsauger durchflitze. Toppprodukt!

@Z: Greta übertüncht

<pic images/greta-1.ps Noch wacht Greta strengen Auges über das Tenderloin-Viertel.>

<em>Michael</em>
Was Klimakleber angeht, wisst ihr in Deutschland sicher
besser Bescheid als wir hier in den USA, aber die Greta kennen wir natürlich auch.
Deswegen musste ich doch sehr lachen, als ich vor etwa einem halben Jahr dieses
Wandportrait von ihr, ein sogenanntes "Mural" mitten in der Stadt entdeckte, direkt
um die Ecke von meinem Zahnarzt. Das Bild hatte irgendwas Gruseliges, wie
eine Puppe, die im Regal sitzt und einen anstarrt.

<pic images/greta-2.ps Im Januar 2024 wurde das Mural übermalt>

Jetzt ist Greta aber in Ungnade gefallen wegen ihrer politischen Äußerungen,
und neulich berichteten Passanten aus San Franciscos Innenstadt, dass das
Gemälde, das meines Wissens auch nicht offiziell dort aufgepinselt worden war,
nun breitflächig mit einem beigen Farbton übertüncht ist, ebenfalls anscheinend
in einer von jugendlichen Rebellen durchgeführten Nacht- und Nebelaktion. Nun
ja, mir soll's egal sein, ich fand's nur interessant, wie schnell die Fans
heutzutage ihre Idole hochputschen und dann fallen lassen, nur weil sie
irgendeinen Schmarrn daherreden. Mit zunehmendem Alter stelle ich auch fest,
dass ich früher viel Schmarren geredet habe, aber mei, so ist das halt wenn man
jung ist, Schmarren reden gehört zum Lernprozess! Zum Glück hat mich niemand
gecancelt, sowas gab's damals nicht.

Grüße aus Deutschlands Zukunft:

Angelika und Michael
