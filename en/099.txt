@Z: Americans Like Burnt Food

<pic images/daves-sandwich.ps (#1) My colleague Dave at Yahoo likes to burn his lunch toast until it's black.>

<em>Michael</em>
A good quality steak develops a great intensive flavor if cooked
on an open-fire grill. But if you leave it on until it turns
dark, German guests will proclaim that the blackened surface causes
cancer, send it back to the kitchen, or grudgingly cut around the burnt parts.
Interestingly, Americans don't share the same health concerns, and
flat-out love their barbecue meat flame-grilled to a point where Germans
would consider it burnt.

Take Dave, my colleague at work, for example. He often prepares a 
lunch sandwich at the cafeteria and leaves the bread in the toaster until 
it's almost black (Figure (#1)). When I jokingly comment that he could
just as well smoke a cigarette, he vehemently dismisses my claim and when
I ask why he's burning his toast, he laughs and says 
"Because I like it that way!".
To understand the irony of this, you need to know that Dave neither smokes 
nor drinks, because it's unhealthy.

Most Americans develop a fondness for burnt food as early as pre-school. 
Boy and girl scout groups like to roast fluffy 
<LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshmallow|marshmallows</LINK> over
bonfires when they are out camping, until the surface of those sugary sweets 
turns completely black. Along with a wafer of chocoloate, they're squished
between two bisquit halves, and kids just love to eat them. The
dish is called a <LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smore|S'more</LINK>,
which allegedly is derived from "Some more" (Figure (#3)).

<pic images/grilled-items.ps (#2) A supermarket flyer in my mailbox shows burnt grilled meat.>

Hardly anyone in Germany would be drooling over the partially burnt
grilled items in the supermarket flyer in Figure (#2). But the question
remains, is eating charred food really as harmful as it is 
believed in Germany? Enjoying burnt items once in a while probably won't do
any harm, just as we occasionally eat fried bacon and eggs like when on
vacation, although our medically inclined friends would probably 
be rolling their eyes over this.

@Z: Absurd and Funny American TV Shows

<pic images/storage-wars.ps An abandoned storage unit is auctioned off in "Storage Wars" and bidders are only allowed to peek inside briefly.>

<em>Angelika</em>
We keep discovering new television shows via Netflix streaming
(<RBLINK>20101219#3</RBLINK>), most of which we'd probably never had
found out about otherwise. Here's a selection of the craziest shows:

Firstly, there's the reality show "Storage Wars". I've reported previously
that it is common for U.S. households to rent additional small
storage spaces for unneeded junk (<RBLINK>20091104#8</RBLINK>). Now, 
California law says, that the content of these storage lockers can be 
auctioned off by the storage facility if the owner is more than three months
behind on the rent payments. That's exactly what this show is about.

Potential buyers at the auction face a peculiar restriction: They are only 
allowed to peek into the locker that's about to be 
auctioned off from the outside, i.e. they can't open any moving boxes 
or dig further into the layers of items in the locker. 
When they're placing a bid at the auction, all they can
rely on is their experience with the content of previously purchased lockers.
Of course, most lockers only contain utterly worthless junk that should 
rather be disposed of immediately at at the local garbage dump.
But often times, between items that no sane person would keep around,
there may be a folder with valuable old baseball cards or a framed painting
from a famed artist which is heavily sought after by art collectors.
I've always loved stories about what people keep or throw away, and about
finding treasured items in hidden attics. Not surprisingly, "Storage Wars"
strikes a cord for me.

The auctions in the show are held mainly in southern California. 
Dan and Laura Dotson are the auctioneers who strive to find buyers for 
the contents of abandoned lockers. The rest of the lineup are professional
buyers. For example, Dave Hester is a seasoned pro, who recently started
running his own auction firm. He is often employing devious tactics to 
outbid other buyers, sometimes just to mess with them. Darell Sheets is another
buyer whose day job it is to acquire merchandize in auctions and sell them
for a profit. Then, there's a married couple, Jarrod Schulz und Brandi
Passante, who own a thrift store. They typically only bid on typical
household items and furniture and their budget is quite limited.
Another buyer, Barry Weiss, bids for the fun of it and only has an eye on 
collector's items and antiques.

Another TV show, "Property Wars" goes even beyond offering
other people's storage items. It auctions off entire foreclosed
properties. The show is recorded in Arizona, the state that was 
hit hard economically a couple of years ago when the housing bubble 
forced many home owners into forclosure. The rules of the game 
are similar in that
potential buyers aren't allowed to inspect forclosed homes from the inside.
The winning bidder gets the property and hopes that they can flip
it at a higher price later.

<pic images/extreme-couponing.ps This woman has been clipping coupons to acquire exorbitant amounts of toilet paper.>

Another funny, although borderline crazy show is "Extreme Couponing", which
portraits notorious tightwads in their quest to cut their grocery bill
to almost zero, by maximizing their savings while exploiting store rebates.
Michael has previously written about the ubiquitous store coupons in the
U.S. (<RBLINK>20020324#10</RBLINK>). There's several coupon variants,
some cut the price of an item by, say, 50 cents, others reduce the price of 
a second item by half or give it away for free, after the customer has
bought the first one at full price. Where do savings enthusiasts get their
coupons? Even with the Internet as market driver, coupons today are
mostly distributed with the print edition of the Sunday paper. Grocery 
chains like Safeway are sending them out individually by mail as well.

<pic images/coupons.ps (#4) This coupon booklet is being delivered to our mailbox every Monday.>

On Mondays, for example, we always find a booklet with coupons 
(Figure (#4)) issued by
various stores in our mailbox. Various sites online offer coupon leaflets
for printing at home, and recently, coupon smartphone apps have been
popping up.
Now, an "Extreme Couponer" is a person whose life revolves around filling
binders with coupons and, when the time is right, marches down to the
supermarket to unleash them all at the same time. Many of them are
picking stores strategically, as some double the coupon value.

These maneuvers can lead to dramatic savings if buyers purchase exorbitant
amounts of the same product. The people featured on the show often end up
with entire shelves full of toilet paper, deodorant, potato chips, 
peanut butter, or mustard. Many fall into the "hoarder" category and 
often have trouble finding space for new purchases. Realistically, it's 
questionable if someone really can ever use up fifty packs of deodorant,
so it's probably not a good deal even if they can get it dirt cheap.

You might wonder why stores participate in this game. That's easy: They
get reimbursed for the coupon amounts by the manufacturer of the sold
product. Those companies have a vested interest in pushing their products 
to the consumer, one step ahead of the competition, and that's why they
sweeten the deal by issuing coupons. Arguably, extreme couponers are 
hardly a lucrative target for the industry, but if you think about the monetary 
value of product placement during the show, they can easily make up for
the lost price margin.

@Z: San Francisco Tourist Attractions

<pic images/robben-pier39.ps Alright, alright, the seals at Pier 39 are pretty aswesome.>

<em>Michael</em>
We've been living in San Francisco for 16 years already and know our
way around the city pretty well. Every once in a while, we get German
visitors who then want to know what to do in the city. We're usually
rolling our eyes when they insist on going to the touristy 
"Fisherman's Wharf" area, but we've given up on lecturing our friends
that this is a waste of time. For some reason, "Fisherman's Wharf" is still
listed in the mainstream travel guides, and apparently, if you told
your friends back home that you were on vacation in San Francisco but didn't
go to the tourist area and ate clam chowder soup out of a hollow loaf of
sourdough bread, they'd probably think that something is wrong with you.
Oh well.

During years and years of exploring the city, however, we've kept adding to 
our collection of lesser known visitor attractions, which even the locals 
here in town find worthwhile going to occasionally. Today, I'm going
to open the secret vault and let it all out!

<pic images/crissy-view.ps Gorgeous city views from Crissy Fields.>

<em>Take a ride on the Cable Car.</em> There's a ticket booth for tourists
at Powell (next to the Bank of America ATM machines) selling daily and weekly
passes for all public transportation in San Francisco (MUNI, BART, and 
Cable Car combined), buy one, it's a great deal. Be there early, as 
around nine the line at the Cable Car gets longer and longer, at times
the wait is an hour or more. Exit at Fisherman's Wharf. The Wharf area isn't
really that rewarding, but tourists can't be talked out of going there,
so just get it over with.

<pic images/ocean-cliff-house.ps The city beach Ocean Beach featuring the Cliff House.>

<em>Take a ride to Crissy Fields.</em> (or if you like hiking, it's about
three miles from the Wharf). Stroll about one and a half miles alongside
the Bay to Golden Gate Bridge. Get on the bridge, walk on the footpath to 
the first pillar (or all the way to the other end if you like). Alternatively,
to get to Crissy Fields, rent a bicycle at "Blazing Saddles" at the Wharf
and ride over there.

<pic images/sand-dollar.ps There's hundreds of these "Sand Dollars" washed ashore at the city beach Ocean Beach on a good day.>

<em>Walk barefoot in the sand at Ocean Beach.</em> Either start just south
of the Cliff House or further south at the end-of-the-line stop Ocean Beach
of the N-Judah MUNI street car. Walk south as far as your feet will carry
you. Alternatively, park at Sloat Street (about 2 miles south) and walk
north. Collect clam shells and sand dollars.

<pic images/mission-st.ps Mission Street in the mexicanischen neighborhood "Mission".>

<em>Explore the Mission (mexican neighborhood).</em> If you're hungry, enter 
a taqueria and order a burrito or tacos. The number of people standing in line
are usually a reliable indicator of how good the place is. My personal 
recommendations: "La Taqueria" (2889 Mission Street), 
"Papalote" (3409 24th Street). Recommended walking path through the Mission:
On 24th street, go from Potrero Street to Valencia Street. At Balmy Street 
(a tiny alley between Harrison Street and Treat Ave), take a short detour and 
check out the murals (South American style wall paintings). On Valencia 
Street, explore the hip/crazy stores between 24th Street and 16th Street. 
If you're not easily scared, proceed till Market Street and notice some 
run-down blocks around 14th Street. Alternatively, stop at 16th Street and
visit one of the restaurant and bars. Or, enter the Zeitgeist bar and
beer garden on Valencia Street at 14th Street.

<pic images/mission-24th.ps These wall paintings in the Mission neighborhood are called "Murals".>

<em>Take the Alcatraz tour.</em> But book your ticket weeks (!) in 
advance!

<em>Skate through Golden Gate Park on rented roller blades.</em>

<em>Visit the hippie neighborhood Ashbury-Haight.</em> Check out the stores 
with vintage and new hippie clothes between Ashbury Street and Golden
Gate Park entrance. There's even vinyl record stores! Juvenile runaways from
all parts of the country seem to gather here, loitering on the sidewalks. 

<pic images/napa-vinyard.ps Vines in Napa Valley.>

<em>Get a rental car, drive to Napa or Sonoma Valley up north.</em>
That'll take about 1.5 hours one way. Many vineyards offer wine tasting,
it's no longer free, usually they charge between $5 to $20. Very good
(but expensive) restaurants. If you like great traditional American food,
I'd recommend Rutherford Grill.

@Z: David's Tea

<pic images/davids-tea.ps A tea store opened in our neighborhood.>

<em>Angelika</em>
In our Noe Valley neigborhood, there's a lot of churn these days in terms of
stores, since the rents are astronomically high. Many small stores can't 
make enough revenue to compete. Every time when a place goes out of 
business, we dread what might replace it. Lately, 
bank branches and real estate brokers seem to occupy 24th Street 
in droves.
In light of this, I was very pleasantly surprised when the former
gift store "Ladybug Ladybug" turned into the tea store
<LINK>http://www.davidstea.com|"David's Tea"</LINK>. My Northern-German
soul rejoiced!

David's Tea originated from up north as well, Canada, to be precise. Back in
2008, David Segal opened the first store of this chain in Toronto. They've
grown to about 90 stores all over Canada and the U.S., which seems to be
the way to go around here if a business is doing well. David's Tea has
excellent teas, starting with the usual black, green, white, and 
fruity teas, but also offering Roibush and various blends with coconut
or vanilla. You'll find more than 150 kinds of tea there, and also
nice accessories like mugs and tea pots. For Christmas, I even found 
tree ornaments filled with tea!

@Z: Culinary Delectabilities: The Cobb Salad

<pic images/cobb-salad.ps An American tradition: Der Cobb Salad. Foto: flickr[Blue moon in her eyes|bluumwezi/6750185115]>

<em>Michael</em>
Today, I'm going to introduce an item you'll probably find on American
menus: the so-called 
<LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb_salad|Cobb Salad</LINK>.
It's a simple, but quite tasty dish, in a way, it's a pimped-out salad.
Along green lettuce leaves, it features crispy fried bacon pieces, 
slices of chicken meat, and hard-boiled eggs.

<pic images/cobb-salad-menu.ps The Cobb Salad with tri-tip is priced at \$13.95 at this restaurant.>

Usually, it also comes with avocado and Roquefort blue cheese, and
a marinade made of vinegar and oil, called "French Dressing" in the
United States. Of course not mixed into the salad, but on the side
in an extra cup, because Americans prefer to mix in the marinade by hand,
instead of having kitchen staff take care of it.

The legend goes that restaurant owner Robert Howard Cobb invented this
special salad in the 30ies of the past century, and allegedly
he or his kitchen chef simply whipped up a salad made with
leftovers after a hectic evening at the restaurant.

@Z: U.S. Bureaucracy goes Europe: FATCA

<pic images/tax-despair.ps With FATCA, Obama has created an unprecedented bureaucracy nightmare that discourages U.S. residents from maintaining foreign bank accounts in Europe.>

<em>Michael</em> Recently, our bank in Germany notified us that they no longer
want our money. A new tax law called
<LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act|FATCA</LINK>,
the so-called "Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act", extends the reach
of the U.S. tax bureaucracy deeply into Europe, where it, via
treaties ratified by European governments, forces banks to 
report data on accounts owned by U.S. residents back to U.S. 
tax authorities. Banks in Germany, for example, are obligated to report
to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on a regular basis, which
U.S. residents have how much money stashed away in foreign accounts, 
to make sure those investors don't forget to pay their taxes in 
their country of residence.

<pic images/hafner.ps The Hafner bank located in the city of Augsburg, Germany, cancels the account of a U.S. resident because of unmanagable American tax bureaucracy.>

If you know about the typical American obsession with bureaucratic 
process (which, ironically, most Europeans have no clue of), you can imagine 
that this new ordinance is peppered with idiotic clauses and 
requires filling out inane forms, which means European banks would have
to purchase expensive software to cope with it. Instead, most smaller banks
simply decided to cancel all accounts held by U.S. residents.

The acronym "FATCA" is most likely supposed to allude to "Fat Cat" 
tax evaders, which it was designed to discourage. It wants to track down
U.S. investors who put their money into foreign accounts and don't
declare the gains on their U.S. tax report. Unfortunately, the new
requirements backfired also for U.S. citizens working in Europe and in 
need of a bank account: Only very few banks are accepting their applications.

The requirement has been ratified a while ago and went into 
full effect in 2013. France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK have 
agreed to comply and are sending account data to their American big brother.
China has declined.

@Z: Protective Toilet Seat Covers

<pic images/toilet-seat-cover-1.ps Above almost every public toilet, there's a dispenser with disposable toilet seat covers.>

<em>Michael</em>
Americans are generally more afraid of germs than the average German. You
can easily see that here in the U.S., because no one would show up for
an event with a cold. Spreading germs is considered to be 
extremely impolite. Or check out the dispensers with the desinfectant 
"Purell" in the bathrooms of companies and museums: They clearly spell
out "Germophobe" to visiting Germans, who'd rather stay clear of 
the heavy artillery of products like Lysol or Chlorox.

Another manifestation of this phobia is the disposable toilet seat cover,
to be found in
almost every public toilet. These are razor-thin paper products in toilet
cover shape which are to be draped onto the toilet seat before sitting
down.

Extracting disposable covers from of the wall dispenser requires some 
practice, usually people do this
by pulling the front-most cover 
slightly upwards first to loosen it, followed by a forceful down movement 
to get it out. Not following
these instructions will result in torn covers, rendering them unusable. 
This requires some practice, but after a few tries, you'll get the hang of it.

Then the folded cover needs to be carefully unfolded and draped over the
toilet seat, followed by quickly sitting down in less than three seconds,
or the automatic flush will trigger and tear the cover down the drain.
You can always try again.

For reasons of packaging efficiency, however, the paper covers aren't
shaped like toilet seats when they're extracted from the dispenser. Instead,
they're rectangle-shaped with rounded edges, and feature a partially 
punched-out inner oval core. Removing this core at the predetermined breaking
points without tearing the entire cover apart often is a race
against time.

<pic images/toilet-seat-cover-2.ps A thin paper cover draped onto the toilet seat prevents the skin from touching the plastic.>

For what it's worth, I was stuck at the shabby Charles-De-Gaulle
airport in Paris once for a few hours, and noticed that not only they 
don't have toilet seat covers there, but no toilet seats at all! France:
What an absurd country, I imagine people are hovering in acrobatic poses 
over the public toilet bowls. But I digress.

Another noteworthy point about American toilets is that they're 
all so-called deep-flushers, meaning there's about five liters of water
in the bowl at all times, receiving each dropped chunk with a loud plunge.
German toilets, on the other hand, feature a receiving plateau or shelf
with no water, which Americans find hilarious, when they're visiting in
Germany.

@Z: Paper Books Going Away

<pic images/regal.ps The book shelf in Michael's home office is getting cleared out.>

<em>Michael</em>
For decades, I've been accumulating paper books at home. This was especially 
wasteful with computer books, which were taking up space on my shelves
for years to come after I had read only a few relevant pages in them and
them put them aside.
But thanks to the eBook revolution, which Germany is only beginning to
see now with a few years of delay compared to the U.S., I came up with the
idea to chop up my entire library, digitize the books by scanning them and put
them online for me to read them wherever I might roam. Regardless
of whether I'm waiting at the supermarket register or relaxing in a comfy
folding chair at the beach, I can always access any of my 450 books and
read a few pages if I feel like it.

TODO_NOT_TRANSLATED_YET

Neue Bücher kaufe ich neuerdings digital bei Amazon für den Kindle, und
das Format kann man auch auf allen möglichen Tablets und Mobiltelefonen
lesen. Dank dem neuen Schnetzelverfahren
stehen nun auch die Papierwälzer digital parat, die bislang zuhause 
Regalmeter verfraßen. Mit ausgelöst haben den radikalen Schnitt 
natürlich die erhöhten Gepäckgebühren 
beim Flug in den Urlaub. Da ich mir nicht mehr erlauben kann, 2 Kilo 
Bücher mitzunehmen, nehme ich jetzt einen iPad mit und schon kann ich lesen
was ich will, wann immer es mir beliebt.

<pic images/book-scan-2.ps Eine Guillotine schneidet den Buchrücken ab.>

Zum Digitalisieren schneide ich bei Hardcovern zunächst mit einem
Teppichmesser den Buchrücken ab und lege die entblößten gebundenen
Papierstapel dann in eine sogenannte Guillotine ein, ein scharfes Fallbeil
aus China, das ich auf Ebay für 150 Dollar erstanden habe. Dann zieht
ein Einzelblattscanner die Seiten ein und scannt sie doppelseitig. Das
digitale Format speichere ich dann auf einem Google Drive auf dem 
Internet ab, damit ich von überall darauf zugreifen kann.

<pic images/book-scan-3.ps Und schließlich füttert er die losen Seiten in einen Einzelblattscanner.>

In Abbildung (#8) seht ihr, wie ein digitalisiertes Papierbuch aus meiner
ehemaligen Bibliothek auf meinem neuen iPhone5 erscheint. Es lässt sich 
sogar auf der kleinen Anzeige gut lesen, und sogar noch besser auf einem
großformatigeren iPad oder Android-Tablet. Die zerschnetzelten Bücher
sind allesamt in der Altpapiersammlung gelandet. 

<pic images/iphone-3.ps (#8) Sogar auf dem iPhone lassen sich die Bücher dann lesen.>

Neulich saß ich beim Friseur und musste warten, bis ich dran kam. Ich 
nutzte die Zeit um ein Computerproblem aus der Arbeit zu lösen, über dem
ich gerade brütete, indem ich
schnell mein Telefon aus der Hosentasche holte, ein 
digitalisiertes Computerbuch aus meiner Sammlung runterlud und 
studierte, bis ich an der Reihe war. Unglaublich, in was für einem 
Zeitalter wir leben!

@Z: Der Schneekettenmann an der Autobahn

<pic images/tahoe-chains-2.ps Der Highway I-80 nach Tahoe ist im Winter oft zugeschneit>

<em>Michael</em>
Über die Weihnachtsfeiertage 
sind wir im Sauwetter ins Skigebiet Lake Tahoe gefahren. 
Der strömende Regen in San Francisco wandelte sich auf der
Paßstraße nach Truckee auf 2000 Höhenmetern in einen Schneesturm um. Damit
niemand liegen bleibt und den Verkehr blockiert, hält das Highway-Personal
jedes Auto an und prüft, ob es Vierradantrieb mit aufgezogenen Winterreifen
hat. Falls nicht, müssen Schneeketten drauf.

<pic images/tahoe-chains-3.ps Schneeketten anzulegen ist kein Zuckerschlecken>

Das Aufziehen der Ketten ist zwar dank moderner Kabelketten kein Problem
mehr, aber es erfordert doch, dass man mindestens 5 Minuten lang im strömenden
Regen oder böse pustenden Schneesturm vor den Reifen kniet und die 
verschiedenen Verschlüsse zumacht. Bei Kälte und steifen Fingern zieht sich
das gerne in die Länge.

<pic images/tahoe-chains-1.ps Kaum gibt man dem Schneekettenmann 30 Dollar, macht er die Ketten drauf.>

Aber die Serviceindustrie Amerikas hat auch hierfür eine Lösung parat: 
Am Straßenrand warten reihenweise Männer in gelben Anzügen die für 30 Dollar
die Ketten aufziehen. Man gibt dem Schneekettenmann die mitgebrachten 
Ketten im Beutel, und darf dann im Auto sitzen bleiben, während der
Schneekettenmann sie im letzten Sauwetter
aufzieht. Man lässt das Fenster nur einen Spalt auf und folgt den
Anweisungen wie "Lenkrad ganz nach rechts einschlagen" oder "ein bißchen 
zurücksetzen" und Minuten später sind die Ketten drauf. 30 Dollar sind
zwar kein Pappenstiel, aber die Servicleistung ist es durchaus wert,
wenn's in Strömen regnet. Die Kabelketten waren 1A aufgezogen und sind
trotz forscher Fahrweise nicht abgesprungen. 

<pic images/tahoe-chain-installer.ps Das Abmachen kostet nur 15 Dollar, aber das kann man auch ganz einfach selbst erledigen.>

Einmal sind wir trotzdem 
stecken geblieben, aber da standen schon LKWs kreuz und quer auf der Fahrbahn.
Wenn die Zugmaschine eines LKW in eine Richtung schaut und der Anhänger
in eine andere, nennt man das auf amerikanisch übrigens
"jackknife", wie ein Taschenmesser.
Wir hingen kurz, aber ein Polizeiauto mit Pufferstoßstange 
hat uns angeschubst und dann ging's wieder, direkt hinter einem Schneepflug 
her. In 5 1/2 Stunden waren wir in Tahoe. Nächstes Mal kaufe ich aber 
richtige Bad-Ass-Ketten für alle Fälle.

@Z: Yahoo-Weihnachtsparty mit der Band "Train"

<pic images/train.ps Die Band "Train" spielt auf der Yahoo-Weihnachtsfeier. Foto: flickr[Saimad|saimad/8237298446]>

<em>Angelika</em> Seit mehreren Jahren schon gab es aus Kostengründen keine
Weihnachtsfeier mehr bei Yahoo. Marissa Mayer, der neue CEO von Yahoo, fackelte
allerdings nicht lange und beschloss, dass 2012 wieder gefeiert wird. Nun ist
die Organisation so einer Party kein Pappenstiel. Meist beschäftigt sich ein
ganzes Heer von Leuten über Monate damit, denn man muss schließlich einen
Veranstaltungsort finden, in dem tausende von Mitarbeitern mit ihren Gästen
feiern können. 

<pic images/train-close.ps Sänger Pat Monahan der Gruppe "Train".>

Wir hatten dieses Jahr Glück, denn die Party fand in San
Francisco statt und zwar am Pier 48. Es gab gutes Essen, ein Casino mit
Roulette und Blackjack, in dem für Losgutscheine gespielt werden konnte und als
Höhepunkt spielte die aus San Francisco stammende Band 
<LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_(band)|"Train"</LINK>. Michael war
total aus dem Häuschen, denn "Train" ist nicht etwa eine Pusselmuckel-Gruppe,
die oft bei derartigen Veranstaltungen spielen, sondern in ganz Amerika 
bekannt, und Michael hört sie rauf und runter.

Grüße aus dem Land der unbegrenzten Möglichkeiten:
