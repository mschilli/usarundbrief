Dear friends,

<em>Angelika</em> 
I've been thinking about for a long time
how my christmas mail this year should look like. But due
to being busy packing boxes to move, I decided to
write a possibly rather impersonal newsletter. On
doing this I can't avoid to tell things some of you
may already know, but better twice than not at all.

We've experienced a year full of events with many
unforgettable highlights such a our wedding in
August. Many of you joined the celebration respectively
kept us in mind. We'll always remember our
celebration as well as our honeymoon to Australia
and we often reminisce about it.

Before and after our wedding, Michael has been working hard on his book. 
In January, he
had written two articles for a computer magazine, that's why the publisher
Addison-Wesley asked him to write a book on the topics
that were outlined in the articles. And he agreed, since it had always
been a dream of his to write a book. So he wrote all the time, while still
doing his main job. In the beginning of December they published 
"Go to Perl 5". And I have to admit that I'm pretty excited whenever I see the
book on the shelves of a bookstore, even though I can't follow the issue
except of the preposition.

@Z: Let's go to San Francisco, CA

<em>Angelika</em> 
So a big dream comes true for us: We're going to live in San Francisco
for a while. Our plan is to stay there for two to
three years. A lot of people keep asking how come
Michael got a job offer in San Francisco. Because this story
is kind of adventurous I'm going to tell you right
here. Those who already know just skip the next
paragraph. 

In April a former colleague gave us a call to ask
Michael if he was willing to work for his current
company in Munich. Michael initially declined because
he didn't want to change his job again. Indeed
he had only been employed at Softlab for one and a
half years. Moreover, he explained that he couldn't do it because
he wanted to work in the U.S. for some time and he was
waiting for such an offer. The colleague was like: "No
problem, just work at our branch in San Francisco." At
first we didn't take it seriously, but a few days
later the manager called and repeated the offer.
That's how it all got started. Finally, Michael had a
firm job contract.

Michael has an American contract, meaning he follows
American working conditions. That is, for instance,
10 days of vacation a year, American medical
insurance, and so on. The company Michael is going to
work for develops new ideas for the Internet. Michael
says:'Now I get money for what I like to do anyways.' 

@Z: A job for Angelika?

<em>Angelika</em> 
One of my main concerns is that I'm not going to be allowed to work.
Americans are very, very strict with work permits and
I only do have a visa to come with Michael. (Michael
calls it a coattail visa). In case I got a job offer
there, the employer would have to show proof that I wouldn't
take the job from any American, which means I'd have to
hire a lawyer to obtain a work permit. It is questionable
if any organisation would the spend time and resources
necessary, as the social area isn't exactly known for swimming in money.
That's why I decided to do some voluntary internships,
which is legal, of course.

Sure enough, it's hard for me to quit my job,
above all, having been in a supervisor position in that
institution. Saying goodbye is even harder because I'm
quite attached to the kids I teach. Well, you can't
have it all. Ultimately, I don't think I'm going to waste away
as a housewife, that's not the way I am.

Certainly, Michael and I will use the time to
experience a lot of the landscape, since California has
a lot to offer. I'm absolutely looking forward to the
ocean that will be literally in our backyard over
there. 

By the way, Michael already flew to San
Francisco on Nov 9th, because he's been working over
there since Nov 11th. I'm going to join on Dec 30th,
after having spent Christmas in Oldenburg with my
parents. It's a strange feeling, to stay without
Michael, but it's only for another two weeks and
we'll see each other.

We're going to spend New Year's Eve with our friends
Sylvia and Richard. Richard and Sylvia are living in San
Jose, an hour drive away from San Francisco. But we're
going to spend New Year's Eve together in San Francisco.
We've booked a candle light dinner on a boat and will
be cruising in the Bay of San Francisco. Sounds great,
huh?

@Z: The Apartment

<em>Angelika</em> 
By the way, Michael has already found an apartment in
San Francisco. Accomodations in the city are pretty
expensive but nevertheless we made the decision to
live where something's going on. If we'd moved to
the suburbs, we would have needed two cars for sure and
I might've been very isolated since I don't work. In
America another problem is that you have to pay for your
safety. That means that apartments in safer areas are
consequently more expensive. For sure, that's a more
common problem in cities than it is in rural areas. 

In order to give you an idea how our apartment looks
like, I briefly quote Michael when he wrote a letter:

<em>Plenty of young people are living in the house,
some of them I already got to know, and they're quite
nice people. The view out of the window is breathtaking:
I'm on the third floor and have a view all over San
Francisco, including parts of the skyline: You can see
all these Victorian buildings, really awesome.

The surrounding is better than Berkeley and anything
I've seen so far from San Francisco: Inumerable small
shops for jewellery, clothes and groceries, a large
supermarket that has open from 6am till 12pm, hair salons
and of course 20 restaurants at least, among them
Japanese as well as Italian. I was really kind of
moved when I went around the corner for the first
time. And it's all just a block away! Despite that, the
apartment is absolutely quiet, it faces the back.
You can't top that, I guess!

Noe Valley, how the neighborhood is called, is totally
safe. Noe Valley is equivalent to Schwabing, just the
American version of it.

The apartment's kitchen is type of a
darkish-brown-American style, kind of ugly but
usable."
</em>

I hope these descriptions make you want to visit us
soon.

Not to forget, we'll live in a two-bedroom apartment
(three bedrooms are not affordable) that has a monthly
rent of $ 1100.

Finally, I'm telling you about our storage boxes: On
December 23rd, most of our stuff is going to be stored
on the big attic of Michael's uncle who lives close to
Augsburg. For the U.S., we have shipped a container, which is
approximately 200 cubic feet in size. It's mostly books, dishes,
clothes and some personal stuff. Plus, our
bed and the good, old IKEA shelves from former student
times have been included. The container was loaded
last week and will presumably arrive in San Francisco
in four weeks.

<pic images/kisteein.ps The container is getting shipped. In two months it is going to appear in San Francisco. We can definitely recommend the company Forster in Munich.>

Well, that's the most important updates. I wish you a
wonderful Christmas and hope that  some of you might
visit us in 1997. Of course, I'll leave with mixed
emotions. We'll appreciate hearing from you regularily, 
so we won't be feeling lonely in the new world.

My next newsletter will be sent from San Francisco.

Love,

Angelika (Munich) and Michael (San Francisco)
