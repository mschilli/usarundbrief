@Z: Stella Awards

<pic images/convjury.ps An attorney is trying to convince the jury with theatrical gestures.>

<em>Michael</em> Readers in Germany have probably heard of the incredible US court case from
1994 <LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants|against
the fast food chain McDonald's</LINK> that a woman had brought, because she had
spilled scalding hot coffee on her lap due to her own clumsiness. The woman was
named Stella Liebeck and has become a symbol for the abuse of the American
court system. In memoriam of this landmark case, Author Randy Cassingham regularly hands out the
so-called "Stella Award" to the most outrageous court cases, and he has compiled the
awarded cases in the book <LINK>http://www.amazon.com/dp/0452287715|The True Stella Awards</LINK>
in an entertaining and educational way.

A liability lawsuit can be quickly filed here in the US, and it is customary
that the plaintiff does not have to pay anything even if the judge dismisses
the case or if the accused company is acquitted. One just needs to find a
lawyer who smells money in the circumstances and takes on the case and costs against a
success fee of up to 50% of the possibly awarded damages sum. No risk for the
plaintiff!

In America, it is not the judge who decides whether a defendant is guilty, but,
as already described in <RBLINK>20020917#5</RBLINK>, Otto Normalverbraucher in
a twelve-member jury. Members of the jury think: "Well, let's give this poor
guy a nice sum of money, who knows, maybe I'll sue a bad and powerful company
myself one day and then I'll get a cut too!" What Otto doesn't consider here is
that companies calculate the costs of their offerings accordingly and simply
pass them on to consumers through price increases.

The victims of this abuse of the judicial system are often doctors who can no
longer save themselves from patient lawsuits in states like Kansas and simply
move elsewhere, where there are not hordes of good-for-nothings waiting for the
slightest misdiagnosis to squeeze out tens of thousands of dollars through
lawsuits. Doctors of course have insurance to cover this, but premiums are
constantly increasing due to the permanent abuse. As a result, there is now an
acute shortage of doctors in rural areas of Kansas.

The legal principle of
<LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_and_several|Joint and Several Liability</LINK>
provides another lever for scammers of all kinds. "Joint Liability" means that,
for example, both partners of a married couple
are responsible for repaying a loan taken out. "Several Liability" means that,
for example, two companies involved in a project are each liable for their
respective share if something goes wrong. The rule of "Joint and several
liability" which is in effect in 46 of the 50 states allows the plaintiff to
use a mixed tactic in their lawsuits: In the case of
<LINK>http://writ.news.findlaw.com/sebok/20040420.html|"Pisco vs.  Coors"</LINK>,
for example, a drunk teenager died and the mother sued three
parties: his girlfriend who lent him her car, her mother who bought her the
car, and the beer company Coors, whose beverage the teenager had been drinking. This
sounds crazy, but if it had been determined that Coors was only 1% at fault,
the company would be liable for the <em>total damage</em> under "Joint and
several liability" because Coors has much more money than the other parties.
When Coors stood up and threatened to sue the mother and her lawyer on basis of
filing a "frivolous lawsuit", the gang of scammers dropped the demands
against the beer manufacturer.

In the book, the following case hasn't been recorded because it is too new: In 2005, a
certain <LINK>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Pearson|Roy Pearson</LINK> sued
a small Korean immigrant-run dry cleaning business in Washington DC for an
astonishing 67 million dollars because the family business had lost the pants
of a suit he had brought in for cleaning. The case actually went to court in 2007, was
dismissed, but the Koreans were left with $83,000 in legal fees. In America,
you don't automatically get those fees reimbursed if you win, you have to
request it and fight for it in court. The immigrants then chose to forego that,
as the case itself had made international waves and sympathetic citizens had
covered the costs with donations. The plaintiff, incidentally, was a judge
himself, who later lost his job because of the case. He is still suing against
it today.

The coffee-spilling Stella, by the way, was initially awarded 2.86 million
dollars by the jury of the proceedings. A judge in most states can then adjust
the amount if he finds that the jury granted excessive amounts, and that's what
he did: $640,000 was the verdict. What Stella ultimately got, however, is not
publicly known, as she reached an out-of-court settlement with McDonald's.
Companies often do this, even if it is costly for them, so that the damage
amount is not be made public. Otherwise, hordes of copycats would swiftly come
with more lawsuits.
