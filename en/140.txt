@Z: Coyotes at close distance

<pic images/coyotes-look.ps (#1) In the evening light, two coyotes are wandering across a cow pasture at Point Reyes.>

<em>Michael</em> We have plenty of wild animals here in America, travelers of
the numerous national and state parks often report sightings of bears, cougars,
buffalo and much more. However, lately there have been reports of wild animals
entering even urban areas, and San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area are
no exception.

<pic images/coyote-playground.ps At the edge of the playing field in St. Mary's Park, coyotes are coming out of the bushes.>
<pic images/coyotes-sign.ps A warning sign to remind owners not to let their dog run free.>

At our Sunday old-timers' soccer game in the Bernal Heights neighborhood, for
example, the playing field borders an area with tall bushes where a coyote
family lives. Warning signs at the entrance of the athletic field remind
visitors of the wild inhabitants and recommend that dogs be kept on a leash and
are not allowed to run free. And indeed, when the weather is sunny, the coyotes
often come out and we can see them rollicking at the edge of the field with
their young.

<pic images/coyote-cat.ps (#2) A resident in our neighborhood saw a coyote eating a house cat.>

Unlike wild cats such as mountain lions, coyotes do not attack humans, unless
they feel directly threatened. They are wild dogs, but they are quite shy and
do not just come up to people. It would be interesting to see what happenes if
a stray soccer ball would accidentally land near the coyotes, I cannot say what
would happen in such a case.  Retrieving the ball would require some courage
and would have to be done without making any sudden movements.

<pic images/coyote-st-marys-at-sign.ps When the weather is sunny, a coyote sometimes comes out to the edge of our soccer field.>

Pets should not be left near coyotes, as they may be foolish enough to provoke
the wild dogs, and that can quickly go wrong. Recently, a resident on the
online forum Nextdoor reported that while walking in our neighborhood, they
observed a coyote eating a calico cat (Figure #2). So be careful!

<pic images/coyote-trail.ps It's not unusual on hiking trails California to see coyotes.>

When we went for a walk on Labor Day weekend during our short vacation in Point
Reyes, about 40 miles north of us, we first came across a herd of cows grazing
freely and then saw two full-grown coyotes peacefully trotting through the herd
in the bright evening light (Figure (#1)). The cows didn't seem to mind
either, so we just kept taking pictures from about 50 yards away. The animals
seemed to be used to each other, yes, it looked like they simply met up every
evening.

@Z: Recalls Galore

<pic images/boudin-wiki.ps San Francisco's District Attorney Chesa Boudin is facing a recall.>

<em>Angelika</em> Our Governor Newsom narrowly escaped a recall recently. Nearly
62% of California voters voted "no" on September 14th to his removal. The
majority of the population probably did not want a political change in these
turbulent times. However, there are still a few other eagerly awaited recall
proceedings pending in San Francisco. Our District Attorney Chesa Boudin will
most likely also have to face a recall procedure. The necessary signatures were
submitted by the end of October and are now awaiting verification from the
relevant authority.

Boudin is a highly controversial person in our city. He has fanatic followers,
but also just as many opponents who would like to drive him out of town. In the
US, prosecutors are elected by the people, which may seem particularly
democratic at first glance, but it has its pitfalls. This means that aspiring
prosecutors have to campaign and, under certain circumstances, promise change
in order to win voter votes that may later backfire when they're actually
in office. There is also a tendency in the US to appoint flashy personalities
to important positions without thoroughly thinking about whether these people
are qualified for the position. For example, Boudin was a public defender, so
he had experience in defending defendants, but not in prosecuting them.

<pic images/sf-burglaries.ps Burglaries in San Francisco have increased significantly during Boudin's term.>

Anyone who has ever seen a typical American courtroom TV series like "Law and
Order" knows that investigating police work closely with the prosecutor's
office to bring about an indictment, while the defense attorney represents the
interests of the accused. Boudin, in a sense, switched sides, but that's not
quite right either. Boudin wants to achieve reforms in the American criminal
justice system and sees the position of prosecutor as more suitable for this
than that of the defense attorney. He belongs to the group of
so-called progressive prosecutors, which are currently en vogue in larger
cities such as Chicago (Kim Foxx), Philadelphia (Larry Krasner) and Los Angeles
(George Gascon). By the way, George Gascon was Boudin's predecessor before
the former ran off to southern California under public pressure before the end
of his term.

No one disputes that the American criminal justice system, with its overcrowded
prisons, high rate of wrongful convictions, and sometimes draconian
punishments, is in need of reform. But how to achieve sensible reforms that are
fair and don't lead to the reverse effect of rising crime statistics is a
matter of much debate. In any case, Chesa Boudin's reform campaign in the
liberal city of San Francisco received the necessary votes in the November 2019
election and he has been in office since January 2020. He won by only a 3000-vote
margin, to the dismay of the police union, against their favorite Suzy Loftus.

<pic images/recall.ps A resident demands to recall the city's district attorney.>

Boudin's life story is quite interesting. Both of his parents spent years in
prison due to their involvement in the left-wing radical group "Weather
Underground" which was founded at the University of Michigan in the late 1960s.
During a robbery of a money transporter, in which members of the group and
Boudin's parents were involved, two police officers and a security guard lost
their lives. Boudin's mother received a prison sentence of 20 years, while his
father's sentence was set to a minimum of 75 years. However, recently, the
outgoing Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, allowed for a hearing to be held
for Boudin's father, David Gilbert, to discuss his early release on parole.
Last week, the responsible committee gave its approval. At the end of November,
he will be released on parole after 40 years in prison. Boudin was only 14
months old when his parents were arrested. He was then raised by the couple
Bill Ayres and Bernardine Dohm, who were also close to the "Weather Underground
Organization". Boudin can't be held responsible for the crimes of his parents,
but the experience shaped him greatly. He often talks in interviews about what
it was like for him as a child to visit his parents in prison.

<pic images/boudin-burglary.ps This San Francisco resident reports two burglars in his apartment, which district attorney Boudin simply let go.>

Boudin has come under criticism in San Francisco mainly because he is very
lenient with repeat offenders and often is not willing to prosecute them,
instead letting them off with probation. This has led to several tragic deaths.
For example, at the end of December 2020, the multiple-convicted Troy Ramon
McAlister killed two pedestrians when he was driving a stolen car, running them
over at an intersection. He had been arrested in November and December for auto
theft and drug offenses, but was immediately released, despite three prior
convictions before 2015. Meanwhile, several prosecutors who worked for Boudin
have thrown in the towel and also campaigned to start an impeachment procedure
against their former boss. A judge in San Francisco also publicly expressed his
dissatisfaction and in particular criticized the chaos under Boudin and the
lack of willingness to do his job and prosecute criminals.

<pic images/door-sign.ps Since thieves go unpunished, package theft has become a real problem..>

Many people in San Francisco are now fed up with how casually the crime
prevention official is dealing with crimes such as home and car break-ins, as
well as shoplifting. These crimes have increased exponentially in San
Francisco. Shoplifting is now so widespread here that supermarkets like Safeway
are shortening their opening hours in the evening or drugstores like Walgreens
are closing several branches after the shelves are emptied by thieves several
times a day. Fairly, it must be mentioned that this situation is also related
to the so-called Proposition 47. The voters in California voted in 2014 that
theft of goods worth less than $950 is only to be considered a minor offense
("misdemeanor") (<RBLINK>20160618#3</RBLINK>) and even reform-resistant repeat
offenders do not have to go to prison.

<pic images/chesa-sign-window.ps Occasionally, one can still see stubborn supporters of the soon-to-be-dismissed District Attorney.>

If it comes to the removal of Boudin, it is not the voter who will determine
who will be the new district attorney, but our mayor London Breed will appoint
a new district attorney of her choice, who will then take over the
responsibility of the removed DA until the end of their term.

And that's not all. In the next newsletter I will report on who is to be
removed from the school board in San Francisco. You see, things are quite
lively around here!

@Z: USA to Germany and Back, In Times of Corona

<pic images/lh-2.ps A completely empty flight from San Francisco to Munich.>

<em>Michael</em>Since we have had the dubious pleasure of flying back and forth
between the US and Germany several times in the last few months, I wanted to
quickly explain what bureaucratic hurdles have to be overcome nowadays due to
Corona.

Anyone flying from the US to Germany currently must present an immunization
certificate to the airline before departure. Additionally, German customs
requires registration <LINK>https://einreiseanmeldung.de|einreiseanmeldung.de|here</LINK>.
The traveler must present a printed document upon entry. During the
10-12 hour flight, the traveler must wear a mask the entire time. Medical masks
are allowed, and some airlines even allow cloth masks. The mask can be removed
while eating or drinking. Different airlines enforce this differently,
Lufthansa is very strict while United is more lax.

In the opposite direction, from Germany to the USA, the Americans require the
airlines to have passengers carry a printed or photographed copy of a negative
result from a Corona rapid test on their phone, no older than three days. The
time does not matter, so if the test was taken on Monday morning at nine
o'clock, one can still fly on Thursday evening with it. The test can be booked
relatively easily at pharmacies and test centers in Germany and is usually the
only patient -- since the test costs real money, practically nobody does it in
Germany anymore.

<pic images/lh-3.ps Flying in times of Corona requires nerves of steel.>

At German airports, there have been sporadic gate changes and hours of delays
lately due to additional security checks, because passengers can't reach their
gate on time. At Munich Airport, passengers going to San Francisco recently had
to wait in line for over an hour before they were allowed to the gate to the
USA. So it's important to stay calm. If the other people in the line are also
on the same flight, the pilot will wait until everyone is on board, no matter
how late it gets.

<pic images/lh-1.ps Depending on the flight time, good deals can be found under certain circumstances.>

Partially the flights are almost empty. I was recently on a Lufthansa flight
with maybe 50 passengers, and that in an Airbus 350-900, which holds 350
people. With fuller flights, Premium Economy and Business are sometimes
practically fully booked, while budget airlines in Economy can stretch out over
three rows, and even passengers from the more expensive areas can scurry to the
back to get some sleep lying down in completely empty rows. But that doesn't
always work, it really depends on how realistic the flight lands at the
destination. If no normal person (who cares about wasted vacation days or
business meetings) would book such a flight, then the chances are high to land
a super deal with a seat in the wooden class. With the easing of travel
restrictions and the start of the holidays in Germany, the flights will soon be
fully booked again. Good luck anyway!

@Z: Packages on an endless journey

<pic images/package-late.ps This parcel from Germany was almost 12 months on its way to San Francisco.>

<em>Angelika</em> Nowadays everyone is talking about the pandemic-related
supply chain problems and we have already written about the container ships
that are stuck in sea traffic. At that time we also reported that we were still
waiting for a Christmas package from Michael's sister, which she had sent by
ship (<RBLINK>20210425#4</RBLINK>). It should be noted that the package started
its journey at the end of October 2020 when it was dropped off at the post
office in Augsburg.

We all thought it had been lost. But lo and behold, just over a year later, in
September 2021, our faithful postman Jose delivered it. He could hardly believe
it when Michael told him that the package had been on the road for so long, as
it was neither damaged nor opened by customs. The address was also clearly
readable. We then wondered what the post office had done with the package and
what adventures the package had experienced on its long journey. According to
the DHL tracking number, the package had not even been handed in to the post
office yet. In any case, we were very happy when it arrived.

<pic images/container.ps Container ships are waiting to be unloaded in San Francisco Bay.>

Coronavirus is now often used as an excuse for why many things don't work or
don't go as planned. I have a particular bone to pick with the German Post, as
they are charging a hefty surcharge on goods sent by airmail to the USA. Normal
letters are exempt from the surcharge, but if you want to send a package by
airmail, there is only the option up to 5 kg, which then costs over 50 euros in
postage.

Although there is the option to send small packages and parcels by ship without
the surcharge, it can take up to a year, as you now know. Furthermore, this is
only possible if the customer arranges the postage online, which is okay if the
customer is told this. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, or it is
promised at the counter that the air package will arrive within 14 days at the
latest, which is why the customer pays more so that the package is transported
faster. However, according to our personal experience, this is not the case.
Six to eight weeks of running time was more standard last year for packages
from Germany to the USA by airmail.

Sure, one understands that in a worldwide pandemic everything takes longer, but
then the customer should not be asked to pay extra at the checkout.
Incidentally, the US Postal Service does not charge such a surcharge for
parcels and packages from the USA to Germany, and the delivery times are much
shorter. It's not entirely understandable, but one blames the other.

@Z: Corona in the Fall of 2021

<pic images/vax-dubliner.ps The Irish pub around the corner only allows guests with vaccinations.>

<em>Angelika</em> When autumn followed summer, San Francisco issued some
confusing mask regulations. According to the latest newsletter, masks for
vaccinated individuals were recommended indoors but not yet
mandatory (<RBLINK>20210726#1</RBLINK>). However, that changed on August 3rd.
Regardless of whether vaccinated or unvaccinated, masks were required by everyone
in public indoor spaces, such as supermarkets, museums, churches, and fitness
studios. However, this regulation was relaxed again on October 15th. If you are
vaccinated, you do not need to wear a mask in San Francisco at work in the office,
during worship services, in fitness centers, or during other gatherings.
However, this is only the case if the vaccination status is verified at the
entrance. Masks are still mandatory in schools, public transportation, shops,
doctor's offices, and hospitals. Furthermore, since August 20th, only vaccinated
individuals are allowed to visit the indoor areas of bars, restaurants, fitness
studios, and museums in San Francisco. Certificates are checked at the
entrance. A negative COVID test is no longer sufficient to gain entry. Children
under 12 are exempt from this rule, as they cannot yet be vaccinated.

<pic images/vax-digbys.ps The restaurant on our street only serves vaccinated guests.>

The discussion about the Covid booster vaccination also got out of hand after
President Biden pushed ahead without consulting his responsible authorities and
promised everyone the so-called "booster" in the fall. This angered many
scientists because the data on a booster vaccination had not been cleared. In the
meantime, the following recommendations apply in the USA: Everyone over 65
years old should receive the booster. The same applies to those over 18 who
have risk factors such as cancer, diabetes, and chronic diseases of the liver,
kidneys, lungs, or heart, as well as those who have a weakened immune system
for other reasons. The third booster group includes those over 18 who work in
professions where they are exposed to an increased risk of Covid because they
encounter many people (including unvaccinated ones) at work. This applies to
teachers, police officers, firefighters, postal workers, bus drivers, or
employees in restaurants and supermarkets. I fall into this third category, and
I have already made an appointment for the third shot. I will report on it
afterward. Incidentally, different vaccines can now be combined for the
"booster," possibly soon following the motto: "Which vaccine would you like
today?"

@Z: Construction Site "Ocean Beach"

<pic images/ob-sand-sign.ps (#3) The contracted construction company announces a sand relocation at the city beach "Ocean Beach.>

<em>Michael</em> Our city beach on the Pacific side is quite famous and
notorious. At the so-called "Ocean Beach," anyone can walk for miles for free
and enjoy the breathtaking views. Hikers can see all sorts of marine life, such
as albatrosses, dolphins, seals, or whales. The beach stretches endlessly, from
San Francisco's now-closed Cliff House in the north down to the suburb of Daly
City. During winter storms, 30 foot high monster waves break off the coast,
which even the most daring surfers avoid. On warm summer days, walkers only
hear the splashing, and strollers enjoy fabulous sunsets. We walk there a few
times a month and have surely covered a thousand miles by now.

<pic images/ob-sand-before.ps Before: Rocks and plenty of space up to the waterline.>

However, the cold and treacherous ocean claims a few reckless individuals every
year, who, often intoxicated, venture too close to the water and are then
grabbed and dragged in by sudden "sneaker waves." Without a wetsuit, it's "game
over" after just a few minutes due to the cold water, as the muscles fail, and
even those who are otherwise good swimmers sink and drown. I've surfed there
before, but I must say that I would only recommend it to beginners when there
are baby waves, and the enormous current, which pulls you towards the bay or
sweeps you south depending on the time of day, requires good paddling
technique on the board, a well-trained back musculature, and nerves of steel.

<pic images/ob-sand-after-1.ps Afterwards: Newly piled sand as a death trap for unsuspecting tourists.>

The beach borders the waterfront road "Great Highway," the fortification of
which, as previously reported (<RBLINK>20120801#8</RBLINK>), partially consists
of old tombstones from the former city cemetery of San Francisco. Over the
years, however, the ocean has gradually claimed more and more sand from the
beach, causing city officials to fear that it might also erode the street
fortifications. Without delay, they initiated a construction project that used
a barge anchored in the ocean to pump sand onto the beach, where it was then
piled up with heavy construction machinery (Figure (#3)).

<pic images/ob-sand-construction.ps During the construction work, the beach was closed.>

Said and done! After several months of construction, there is now a six to
eight feet high layer of sand between the ocean waves crashing onto the beach
and the reinforcement of the coastal road. However, what the builders
apparently overlooked is that when the tide comes in, a very narrow death zone
is created between the sand wall and the water for walkers, from which there is
no easy escape, as no one can climb a sand wall. We recently went for a walk
there at three-quarters tide and almost got wet from the waves creeping up. I
predict that it will get dangerous at high tide. Hopefully, the rescue
personnel stationed further north will intervene in time in case of an
emergency.

@Z: Rip-off at the airport: 8 dollars for a luggage cart

<pic images/smarte-carte-1.ps The San Francisco airport seriously charges eight dollars for a luggage cart.>

<em>Michael</em> Whenever we're flying back to San Francisco from Germany, we travel
with heavy luggage. Often, it's four large bags, packed full and carefully
balanced until the maximum weight is reached. However, after landing and
picking up the luggage from the conveyor belt, the problem arises of
maneuvering the suitcases about a quarter mile (and up an elevator) to the taxi
stand. Every airport in the world provides luggage carts for its passengers,
sometimes for a small fee at popular transfer points. For example, in
Frankfurt, renting a cart costs one Euro.

<pic images/smarte-carte-2.ps For each of these carts, a passenger shelled out eight dollars for ten minutes of use.>

Until recently, this was also the case at SFO, the international airport of San
Francisco. However, the cart operating company "Smarte Carte" apparently
thought, "Why not cash in big time and jack up the prices? What else are the
passengers going to do, carry their luggage themselves?!" In my imagination,
the haggard figures in the boardroom then burst into loud, evil laughter,
similar to Dr. Evil's henchmen in the movie "Austin Powers."

Well, of course, one could carry less luggage and each person could just roll a
suitcase, but for those of us who like to shop, unfortunately, this option is
not available. Just like an obviously British gentleman who, struggling to
balance three suitcases without a luggage cart in the elevator up to the taxi
stand, whispered to me: "I can't believe they're taking 8 dollars for a cart!"
and I had to agree with him with "Yep, it's ridiculous!" Because from those 8
dollars, the passenger gets exactly zero dollars back when they return the
cart. An employee of the company collects the carts, brings them back to the
machine, and 8 dollars per cart go to the operating company of Dr. Evil. But
apparently, the mayor of San Francisco, London Breed, is not inclined to ensure
that arriving tourists are not already annoyed by the unacceptable conditions
at their vacation destination at the airport. The nightmarishly rundown
downtown later provides them with enough reasons for that!

@Z: Top product: Atul Gawande "Being Mortal"

<pic images/mortal.ps The book "Being Mortal" by Atul Gawande>

<em>Angelika</em> Actually, the section for top products is always reserved for
Michael, but today it's my turn. I love reading, and this month I devoured one
of the best non-fiction books I've read in a long time. The American doctor
Atul Gawande, in his work "Being Mortal" (German title: "Sterblich sein"),
deals with dying and how modern medicine miserably fails to accompany this
process with dignity. It's about what really matters at the end of a life.
Through many personal stories (including that of his own father), Gawande
illustrates how often people are treated and managed without considering their
true needs and seeks ways out of this predicament. Highly recommended!

@Z: Traveling as a hobo on a freight train

<pic images/stobe-jump.ps Stobe jumps onto a moving freight train.>

<em>Michael</em> From American Wild West films, we are familiar with the scenes
where penniless individuals travel half across America in empty freight
train cars. You can watch mile-long trains with hundreds of cars sometimes chugging
along at only 10 or 20 mph through the endless prairie, and often there is no
cargo on a car or there is still room for an undemanding passenger in an empty
livestock car. Towards the end of the 19th century, it was mainly traveling
vagrants, known as <LINK>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobo|Hobos</LINK>, using
this free, albeit neither comfortable nor entirely safe method of passenger
transport. Although the railway police are working hard to deter unauthorized passengers
from riding by being present at the loading stations, since the trains
sometimes only travel at a slow pace, hobos often simply jump onto the moving
wagons somewhere along the open track.

Fast forward to today, where riding on freight trains, the so-called activity of
<LINK>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freighthopping|Freighthopping</LINK>
is of course, strictly prohibited. The
railway police carefully ensure that no one sneaks into the partially
fortress-like secured loading stations for freight trains. But a few daring
individuals still are taking on the adventure today. For example, the YouTube
personality "Stobe the Hobo," who not only traveled all over America in freight
trains but also reported about it in captivating videos on YouTube. In these
videos, you can see freight trains rushing through the endless expanses of the
country in bright sunshine, while the protagonist films himself and his
buddy "Wingman" camping in the open wagons, enjoying the ride.

<pic images/stobe-sit.ps Don't be seen by the railway police!>

Stobe accompanies the videos with self-played piano music, mostly classical
interpretations of songs by local rock bands. In one episode in the American
Northwest near Seattle, for example, he played pieces by Nirvana, and one other time,
I recognized the
piece "Heathens" by the band "Twenty One Pilots." The whole thing is presented
in such a cheerful and at the same time calming way that some people in the
YouTube comments have already admitted to using the videos as a sleep aid. As
an introductory recommendation, I suggest you try 
<LINK>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtIlIF-Wkag|"The Pacific Northwest"</LINK>
and I guarantee you that you'll be fascinated and go on an on and won't be able to stop
until you've watched at least several dozen episodes.

<pic images/stobe-beer.ps "Stobe the Hobo" waiting, drinking cheap canned beer.>

Since freight trains run according to a secret schedule known only to the
railroad workers, hobos often have to hang around near track junctions for
hours, sometimes even days, until an opportunity arises to catch a ride in the
desired direction. "Stobe the Hobo," or James Stobie, as he is known by his
real name, camps as a homeless person under bridges and regularly indulges in
his obsession of acquiring large quantities of cheap beer from local
supermarkets. His declared enemies, by the way, are the nerdy railroad
enthusiasts, known as <LINK>https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Foamer|Foamers</LINK>,
who, in the pursuit of their declared hobby, hang around railway tracks all
day with a camera strapped on, photographing trains, and reporting hobos to the
railway police if they discover them engaging in illegal activities.

<pic images/stobe-train.ps Stobe the Hobo in his element on a freight train.>

"Stobe the Hobo" unfortunately had to learn firsthand that jumping onto moving
freight trains is indeed life-threatening: In 2017, he died 
<LINK>https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/stobe-the-hobo-dath/|in a railroad accident</LINK>.
The sad end of a great man, but in his YouTube videos, he will live on forever.
Peace out!

Greetings from the vast expanses of the country:

Angelika and Michael
